			 <p>The Wordpress and open source communities have lots of thoughts on Matt Mullenweg’s actions after his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnI-QcVSwMU">talk at WordCamp</a>. Much of this commentary has overlooked what I think is a core concern at the heart of Matt&rsquo;s argument: the growing role and influence of private equity in tech, particularly in open source.</p>
<p>PE firms raise money from institutional investors and high net worth individuals to buy companies, restructure them, and sell them later for a profit. They&rsquo;re all about maximizing returns ASAP, usually in a 3-7 year window. That&rsquo;s a shorter timeframe than the typical founder or public company shareholder, and far shorter than <a href="https://tim.blog/2024/01/02/matt-mullenweg-2-transcript/">Matt&rsquo;s time horizon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like future generations to grow up with a web that is more open, more free, gives more liberty, and so open source is really my life’s work, even above WordPress and anything else. I hope to work on it the rest of my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a PE firm acquires a tech company, a few things happen. The new owners focus on aggressive cost-cutting and &ldquo;streamlining&rdquo; operations to boost short-term profitability. This is extremely destructive, leading to mass layoffs, reduced benefits, and wholesale outsourcing. At the same time, PE firms often load up acquired companies with debt, extracting cash while leaving the businesses more financially unstable. With a myopic focus on an exit, long-term investments in innovation, customer service, and employee development fall by the wayside.</p>
<p><strong>The result? Private equity backed companies are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3423290">10 times more likely</a> to go bankrupt than public companies.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic business model of private equity firms often leads to disasters like that at ManorCare for three fundamental reasons. First, private equity firms typically buy businesses only for the short term. Second, they often load up the companies they buy with debt and extract onerous fees. And third, they insulate themselves from the consequences, both legal and financial, of their actions. This leads to a practice of extraction, rather than investment, of destruction, rather than creation. While not every company owned by private equity firms goes bankrupt, the chance of disaster meaningfully increases under their ownership.<br>
— <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/21/books/review/plunder-brendan-ballou-these-are-the-plunderers-gretchen-morgenson-joshua-rosner.html"><em>Plunder</em> by Brendan Ballou</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Open source communities are particularly vulnerable to this model. They’re delicate ecosystems of volunteer contributors, transparent governance, and values-aligned sponsorships. Applying the PE playbook can easily destabilize that entire balance.</p>
<p>Take, for example, Vista Equity Partners' $1 billion acquisition of Acquia in 2019. Acquia is the main commercial backer of Drupal, another popular open source CMS. In the years since the acquisition, the Drupal community has visibly struggled. Acquia appears to be contributing less code and providing less financial support to the ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Just a few days ago, Acquia <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexmorenolopez_acquia-drupal-layoffs-activity-7247196514396102658-e8Dt">quietly laid off</a> <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blanksforever/post/DArFDFsSiiu">almost a third</a> <a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/Employee-Review-Acquia-RVW90841435.htm">of its staff</a>.</strong></p>
<p>With fewer resources, core development and maintenance have slowed. This coincides with a <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/Drupal">sharp decline in Drupal&rsquo;s market share</a> compared to competitors like WordPress:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-10-07-at-15.51.452x.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Drupal story demonstrates how applying PE tactics to open source projects can undermine their health and sustainability. By nature, these communities aren&rsquo;t a fit for rapid extraction of outsized returns. Their vitality depends on reinvestment, transparency, and long-term stability — the opposite of the PE model.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/toys-r-us-bankruptcy-private-equity/561758/">Toys “R” Us</a>. <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/08/simon-and-schuster-kkr-paramount-global-book-publishing">Simon &amp; Schuster</a>. Even <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/04/private-equity-ports-strike-dockworker">America’s ports</a>. Not everyone can push back against private equity, but I believe we should support companies like Wordpress that have a long history of admirable values and prescient leadership. Wordpress powers more than 40% of the web — its community’s health is too important to ignore.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zmh.org/2024/08/04/installing-commaai-on.html">Installing Comma.ai on a 2018 Mazda CX-5</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zmh.org/2024/08/04/installing-commaai-on.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-04 22:31:02 -0400">Aug 4, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently ordered a <a href="https://comma.ai/">Comma.ai</a> kit to add semi-autonomous driving capabilities to my 2018 Mazda CX-5. It took some trial and error (and help from the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/FEzeve2NX2">Comma.ai community on Discord</a>) to get it working properly, but I <em>highly</em> recommend it as I’ll explain later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing the steps I took in case it&rsquo;s helpful for others looking to install the Comma 3X on the same or a similar vehicle. It&rsquo;s a pretty intuitive process, all things considered, but there weren’t a lot of guides with photos on how to do the actual installation process.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="a-false-start">A false start</h2>
<p>When I initially received the Comma 3X kit and installed it (follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV7_Su4xbzs">installation video</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@to.jafar/how-to-setup-openpilot-on-mazda-3eb54c62fdc5">Jafar&rsquo;s post</a>, it&rsquo;s pretty simple) I thought I’d be up and running quickly. However, the device seemed stuck in dashcam mode and didn&rsquo;t move the steering wheel at all. After digging into the Discord server and reading more, it appeared to be an issue with fingerprinting my specific Mazda model.</p>
<p>I reset the device and installed a <a href="https://smiskol.com/fork/jafaral/mazda-0.9.6">special fork</a> I found on the Discord server which had more Mazda car fingerprints to help identify how to interface with the car. This worked on a test drive, but the car would beep aggressively every 5 seconds if you weren&rsquo;t holding the wheel very deliberately, making highway driving difficult. Even without Comma installed the car would complain when you had cruise control enabled and weren’t holding the steering wheel in the right place, but adding the Comma made it complain much more.</p>
<p>The Discord community <a href="https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/533836721541087242/628249300555792394">recommends</a> trying a wheel cover with weights underneath, which worked somewhat but was quite bulky. Ultimately, I decided to pursue the ultimate solution I had been trying to avoid: swapping out the EPS motor.</p>
<h2 id="swapping-the-eps-motor">Swapping the EPS motor</h2>
<p>The EPS motor on pre-2022 Mazdas is designed for very lightweight lane departure vibrations. I always thought it felt a bit underpowered, and you could feel the car lightly bouncing between the lane markers. On any serious turn, the car would just continue to depart the lane.</p>
<p>Newer Mazda EPS motors can apply more torque to the wheel, allowing for real LKAS (lane keep assistance) that can turn the car even through 10+ degree curves. I was initially hesitant to replace the EPS motor because I wasn&rsquo;t sure exactly where it was located. But after reading the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/533836721541087242/1250213678108905574">pinned messages</a> on Discord and asking a few questions, the community reassured me it was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>The process ended up being easier than I anticipated, although there were a few tricky parts. Here&rsquo;s a detailed breakdown of how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Order the new EPS motor from eBay — the LKQ store has several options, but you have to make sure the vehicle is model year 2022 or higher. As an example, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_dkr=1&amp;iconV2Request=true&amp;_blrs=recall_filtering&amp;_ssn=lkqonline&amp;store_cat=0&amp;store_name=lkqonline&amp;_oac=1&amp;_nkw=2023%20mazda%20cx-5%20power%20steering%20pump%20oem">here&rsquo;s a search</a> on LKQ&rsquo;s eBay store, or just look for &ldquo;2023 Mazda CX-5 Power Steering Pump OEM&rdquo;. You’ll also need a 10mm and 12mm wrench for later.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll receive a hunk of metal similar to this. The only part needed is the circular gearbox-looking piece on the left of this picture.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8387.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Remove the two bolts pictured here, which will detach the shaft from the EPS motor. Use a 12mm wrench for these and be careful not to lose the small plastic gear in the center of the motor once you remove it.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-08-04-at-21.31.512x.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWTWZWl6Lgc">Disconnect your car battery</a> using a 10mm wrench to prevent the airbags from firing.</li>
<li>While not required, I recommend removing the cover to the left of the steering wheel. It pops out easily and improves access to the EPS motor.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8393.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Now that you’re in, you’ll see the same motor mounted, as pictured here:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8395.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Here&rsquo;s the trickiest part: you need to remove the same two bolts on the old gearbox, but one bolt is close to a piece of metal, making it hard to fit the wrench in. It&rsquo;s doable but will take a few attempts. Both bolts are on quite tight, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to use some force to loosen them.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8398.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8399.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Once the bolts are out, unhook the 3 cables at the top and detach the old motor.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8401.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>One tip: the small gear kept falling out or misaligning as I tried to install the new motor. Rather than fumbling with alignment, I positioned the gear on the other (already mounted) side so it was already lined up correctly. You’ll see what I mean.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8409.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Screw the bolts back in, reconnect your battery, and you&rsquo;re all set! You&rsquo;ll want to install <a href="https://smiskol.com/fork/jafaral/mazda-eps22-swap">this modified fork</a> on the Comma 3X, which tells older Mazdas to use the new EPS motor.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>After installing the new EPS motor, I&rsquo;ve been <em>really</em> impressed with its performance. I wouldn&rsquo;t even bother installing Comma.ai on an older Mazda without it — the experience is just too annoying otherwise.</p>
<p>The upgraded EPS motor enables stop-and-go adaptive cruise control, which by itself is a fantastic improvement for city traffic. It also provides LKAS that keeps the car smoothly centered in the lane without any warnings to keep your hands on the wheel. These enhancements make long drives much more pleasant.</p>
<p>With the new motor, I&rsquo;ve completed a few hundred-mile road trips with only three or four interventions to assist with turning, and just a handful of additional interventions in busy city traffic. It really is quite capable.</p>
<p>Since I had Comma installed before the EPS motor upgrade, I spent some time observing the Openpilot lane markings as we drove. There was never a point where the green outline indicating the car&rsquo;s projected path was misdirected or where the detected lane markers deviated from reality. I also drove at night and in the rain, with no issues whatsoever. This gave me a lot of confidence in the system&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the Comma team for building an incredible hardware product, and to all the maintainers of <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">Openpilot</a> and volunteers in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/FEzeve2NX2">#Mazda Discord channel</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote this post a week ago and have been thinking hard about whether I believe the premise, which is that within a few years, the norm for source code will be that it is written and modified by LLMs via prompting. For all practical purposes, all source code will be written this way, with exceptions becoming ever rarer.</p>
<p>Not only do I believe it, I could even see it happening in 12-18 months at the current rate of LLM progress. I think the change will have a ton of fallout, only some of it foreseeable. And one casualty might well be junior devs, in the sense that they become less marketable and it could cause various kinds of crunches across the industry.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>But change is coming. There will be social and cultural upheaval in tech, just as is happening in the legal profession. It&rsquo;s already begun. The models are getting smarter and smarter with each passing month, which means they are going to be eating more and more jobs until they eat the world.</p>
<p>All I can tell you is this: Get there early. One time Googlers were complaining at TGIF that the parking garage was filling up by midmorning, and Larry Page jokingly suggested, &ldquo;Maybe you should come earlier.&rdquo; At that moment he reeked of billionaire. But if you really wanted to park in the garage, you took his advice.</p>
<p>Get good, fast. That&rsquo;s what you need to do. Get ahead of the slackers while our industry turns upside down, and you might be the one to survive.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t over-index on programming language arcana. That&rsquo;s becoming a detail that machines handle for us. Focus on algorithms, data structures, software design and engineering, discrete math, operating systems, compilers, databases, networks. Focus on studying real systems. Find walkthroughs online and study them. And of course ML. Gobble up everything you can.</p>
<p>Understand how things are built. Make sure you know how every system in a computer works. Make sure you have an understanding of how every cloud service you depend on does its job. Read the docs, and then read the design docs. You won&rsquo;t have to write any of it by hand. But you need to develop a senior programmer&rsquo;s sensibilities around how these things fit together and interact, for good or ill.</p>
<p>Learn how to use frontier models to check other LLM models' work. Sign up for multiple services (e.g. Claude and ChatGPT) and send your important prompts to at least two big models. Have them evaluate each other&rsquo;s responses and study it all carefully. LLMs are better at reviewing and critiquing their own content than they are at producing it. So use a second LLM as your senior partner.</p>
<p>Another one of the key things that differentiates a senior developer from a junior one, in many contexts, is Operations experience. Read the O&rsquo;Reilly/Google SRE book. Read it cover to cover. And find a good GitOps book, too; there seem to be quite a few to choose from. There may be no compression algorithm for experience, but fortunately a lot of that experience has been condensed and distilled. Go drink it up.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what approach you take, as long as you start making heavy use of chat in programming. Because that, friendo, is how it works now. Like it or not. And you need to survive it. Good luck to you.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important insight NASA has gleaned from studying team dynamics—in space and on Earth—is the preciousness of one trait in particular: a sense of humour.

But the most important task by far is that of the clown, a person who is funny and also wise enough to understand each member of the group and defuse tensions.</p>

<p>From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you don’t take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you’ll be ignored so you know the importance of listening to others, and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these things or not, they’re going to happen. And whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The last bit of advice I’ll give you is very simple, but I think it could make a big difference in your life. Once a week, you should write a note to someone. Not an email. A note on a piece of paper. It will take you exactly 10 minutes. Talk to an adult, let them tell you what a stamp is. You can put the stamp on the envelope. Again, 10 minutes, once a week. I will help you, right now. I will dictate to you the first note you should write. It will say, ‘Dear [fill in the name of a teacher at Cardigan Mountain School].’ Say: ‘I have started at this new school. We are reading [blank] in English. Football or soccer practice is hard, but I’m enjoying it. Thank you for teaching me.’ Put it in an envelope, put a stamp on it and send it. It will mean a great deal to people who — for reasons most of us cannot contemplate — have dedicated themselves to teaching middle school boys. As I said, that will take you exactly 10 minutes a week. By the end of the school year, you will have sent notes to 40 people. Forty people will feel a little more special because you did, and they will think you are very special because of what you did. No one else is going to carry that dividend during your time at school.</p>

<p>Mike Krieger: I’ll share a funny anecdote about the Explore experiment. Facebook has all these internal A/B testing tooling and we hooked into it and we ran our first machine learning on the Explore experiment and we filed a bug report and I’m like, “Hey, your tool isn’t working, that’s not reporting results here.” And they said, “No, the results are just so strong that they’re literally off the charts. The little bars that show it literally is over 200%, you just should ship this yesterday.” The data looked really good.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a Moccamaster for the past two years and love the way it makes coffee. Choosing a model was relatively hard though, since they have multiple options and models. A few friends have asked how I picked a model, so I wanted to share the 3 main decisions you&rsquo;ll need to make:</p>
<h3 id="1-glass-vs-stainless-steel-carafe">1. Glass vs. stainless steel carafe</h3>
<p>Stainless steel pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower chance of breaking</li>
<li>Will keep coffee warmer by itself longer (e.g. taking the carafe to the kitchen table)</li>
</ul>
<p>Stainless steel cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harder to clean since it’s not dishwasher safe and the mouth is narrower</li>
<li>Some people are sensitive to the taste that stainless steel imparts to coffee</li>
</ul>
<p>Glass pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Dishwasher safe and easy to clean by hand</li>
<li>No aftertaste</li>
</ul>
<p>Glass cons</p>
<ul>
<li>All the glass carafe models have a hotplate to keep the coffee warm, which means there are a few more parts that could break over time</li>
<li>Easier to break, though it seems quite strong</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-10-cup-vs-8-cup">2. 10 cup vs. 8 cup</h3>
<p>For anything more than 1 person, would definitely get the 10 cup. The “cups” are European sizes (4oz), and  we go through one 10 cup pot easily. Plus, you can easily make less than 10 cups if you don’t need a full carafe.</p>
<h3 id="3-manual-drip-stop-vs-auto-drip-stop">3. Manual drip stop vs auto drip stop</h3>
<p>Manual drip stop has a switch that controls how quickly coffee leaves the brew basket into the carafe. You can close it completely to steep for longer, put it halfway to let it brew more slowly, or open fully to get a weaker cup. We keep ours on half speed all the time and that seems to work really well. Auto dripstop works as soon as you remove the carafe, which is easier but means you don’t have as much control with coffee strength etc.</p>
<p>Manual dripstop pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Can adjust how strong your coffee is</li>
</ul>
<p>Manual dripstop cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing carafe midway through brew is harder — need to fully close the brew basket, use carafe, and then reopen the brew basket</li>
<li>You can easily forget to reopen brew basket, which will overflow if you don’t. (We’ve gotten close to this a few times when absentmindedly making coffee in the morning).</li>
<li>The mechanism is a bit finicky</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few other differences, but basically once you decide on those 3, there’s 1-2 models to choose from.</p>
<p>Ultimately I chose <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0798B6HFY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">this model</a> with glass carafe / 10 cup / manual drip stop — in the future, I might choose the automatic drip stop since it&rsquo;s a bit easier for guests to figure out if they want to make coffee.</p>
<h3 id="other-resources">Other resources</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.beanpoet.com/which-moccamaster-should-i-buy/">https://www.beanpoet.com/which-moccamaster-should-i-buy/</a></li>
<li>The water pouring spout has so-so water distribution by default — new models have <a href="https://us.moccamaster.com/products/outlet-arm-9-holes">this new spout</a> but you can also buy it separately for older models or there are third party options like <a href="https://www.artisansmith.com.au/products/shower-head-for-moccamaster">this</a> and <a href="https://coffeepilot.ca/products/shower-head-insert-for-technivorm-moccamaster">this</a> that spread the water more evenly</li>
<li>Moccamaster recommends using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Urnex-Espresso-Machine-Cleaner-Cleancaf/dp/B000FDDU8G/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1XGR8ZP63XC8O&amp;keywords=descaler+moccamaster&amp;qid=1669592778&amp;sprefix=descaler+moccamast%2Caps%2C123&amp;sr=8-6">this descaler</a> every few weeks - I use it once a quarter with good results</li>

<p><em>This post was originally published on Medium in 2015.</em></p>
<p>In 2014 I was lucky enough to speak at <a href="http://memorialchurch.harvard.edu/morning-prayers-0">Morning Prayers</a>, a secular Harvard tradition that has existed since its founding in 1636. Below is a copy of my remarks.</p>
<hr>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<hr>
<p>Good morning. My name is Zachary Hamed, and I am a senior in Leverett House studying computer science. I’d like to begin with a reading from Ecclesiastes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chance—and its sister, serendipity—are the under-appreciated forces that drive the twists and turns in life. Serendipity is defined as the “the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way.” It was first penned by Horace Walpole in a letter to Horace Mann in 1754, who said he was inspired by an old Persian fairy tale called “The Three Princes of Serendip.”</p>
<p>As the story goes, the King of Serendip had three sons, whom he had educated with the best tutors in the land. After several years, the king felt his sons had mastered all the knowledge of the arts and sciences, but feared they had been too sheltered and privileged in their education. He sent his sons to the desert, where they wandered for days.</p>
<p>Late in their trip, they met a farmer who asked if they had seen his missing camel. The princes asked the farmer if his camel was blind in one eye, had a gap in its teeth, and was injured in one leg. When the farmer heard this, he accused the princes of stealing his camel and took them to the king.</p>
<p>When the king asked how his sons knew such intimate details of a stranger’s camel, they explained that their days of wandering had led them to notice small details in the environment. An animal had eaten the tougher and browner grass on the left side of the road, leading them to believe the animal was blind in one eye. There were lumps of chewed grass along the road that were the size of a camel’s tooth. And there were only 3 camel footprints on the road with the fourth being dragged, leading them to believe the camel was disabled in one leg. As soon as they finished, a traveller entered and reported he had found a lost camel in the desert. The princes were rewarded handsomely and their intuition trusted for years to come.</p>
<p>The story hits close to home because Cambridge resembles Serendip all too often. It is easy for us to be so ensconced in our research, our work, our meetings and our routine that we don’t make time for productive and creative wandering.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, a pair of medical researchers—one at NYU and one at Cornell—accidentally injected rabbits with a certain enzyme and noticed that the rabbits’ ears folded over. Neither had the time or funding to pursue the anomaly, so they buried it away in their lab notebooks. Several years later, only one of the professors decided to review his research notes when he realized the flopping ears were actually more important than his initial research was. <a href="http://www.nap.edu/readingroom.php?book=biomems&amp;page=lthomas.html">His work</a> led to a Nobel Prize, and a <a href="http://www.psyking.net/HTMLobj-3475/The_Case_of_the_Floppy-Eared_Rabbits.pdf">subsequent sociology paper</a> on the topic coined the terms serendipity gained (for example, reviewing your notes and deciding to pursue a question further) and serendipity lost—making the same discovery but never following up.</p>
<p>In short, serendipity enters our lives several times a day. We can gain it or lose it. But the best part is—we can engineer it. MIT Professor Ethan Zuckerman covers this phenomenon of creating luck. “Engineering serendipity,” he says, “is this idea that we can help people come across unexpected but helpful connections at a better than random rate. And in some ways it’s based on trying to reassess this notion of serendipitous as lucky — to think of serendipitous as smart.”</p>
<p>Harvard engineers serendipity at every point it can. You’re placed with a random group of your classmates when you enter as a freshman. Even when you’re allowed to choose your roommates in sophomore year, you’re placed randomly into houses and a lottery randomly places you into rooms. The lectures in your general education class could help you on a completely unrelated assignment in a different class. And have you noticed how many walking paths there are outside this very church? Walking through Harvard Yard is a case study in serendipity—it’s almost impossible to avoid seeing someone you know.</p>
<p>We meet best friends at events in Ticknor Lounge, significant others in early morning sections in Sever, mentors over lunch in Leverett dining hall, and overhear job opportunities in Lamont Cafe. Every minute on Harvard’s campus is a chance encounter waiting to happen.</p>
<p>Harvard’s secret is it takes a diverse group of people and squeezes them into a small, confined space. But the real world is a big place. And the scariest part is that serendipity will no longer be engineered for us. In fact, New York City, where I’ve been living for the past 4 months, seems to be engineered against serendipity. Have you ever tried meeting someone new on a New York City subway train? In a city of 8 million people, how do you find your new best friend? Your new job opportunity?</p>
<p>As always, Ralph Waldo Emerson provides the answer. “Shallow men,” he says, “believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect.” It is up to us to engineer serendipity once we leave Harvard’s gates. So talk to the person behind you in line at the coffee shop. Knock on your neighbor’s door in the otherwise anonymous apartment building you live in. Ask your friends to introduce you to someone new and go to lunch with them.</p>
<p>Be open to the unexpected today. Relish the uncertain. And embrace serendipity.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zmh.org/2013/12/03/the-best-lessons.html">The 20 Best Lessons from Social Psychology</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zmh.org/2013/12/03/the-best-lessons.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2013-12-03 22:46:21 -0400">Dec 3, 2013</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last spring, I took a class on social psychology. It was one of the most useful classes I’ve ever taken, so I figured I’d share some of the more interesting findings. Each paragraph has a citation to its right so you can get more information or read the original study.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>1. Reciprocity has a strong effect on us.</strong></p>
<p>20% of people send Christmas cards back to people they’ve never met, just because they received one from them. For the same reason, tips to waiters go up 3.3% when an after-dinner mint is provided with the receipt. And when the server looked the diner in the eye and gave them a second mint? Tips went up 20%.</p>
<p><strong>2. You attribute a higher value to things you already own—this is known as the endowment effect.</strong></p>
<p>Willingness to sell was twice as high as willingness to pay in one study. In other words, participants were willing to buy a mug for $5, but once they owned it, they wouldn’t sell for less than $10.</p>
<p><strong>3. Heat makes us angry, and sadness physically makes us colder.</strong></p>
<p>When you feel rejected, you report the room as being colder and you prefer warmer foods over colder foods. Crime rates are higher in hotter regions, and crime is more likely on warmer days. Baseball pitchers are more likely to hit batters when it’s hot. This occurs because heat causes arousal, but people misattribute that arousal to situations around them and not to the heat.</p>
<p>Duchenne smiles (example B) that are exhibited in high school yearbook photos are correlated with better life outcomes 30 years later. Here, Paul Ekman—an expert in facial psychology—exhibits both non-Duchenne (exhibit A) and Duchenne smiles.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>4. Smiling is contagious—and can predict your happiness, professional success, and lifespan.</strong></p>
<p>Humans laugh more at movies when other people laugh. Additionally, many people smile at getting a strike in bowling only after they turn around to their friends—you smile for the social approval, not for doing something successfully. In another study, students who exhibited “Duchenne smiles”—a more authentic type of smile that engages the eye and mouth muscles—in their high school yearbook were more likely to get married and were more likely to self-describe as “happy” 30 years later. Students with less intense smiles were more likely to be divorced. And in any given year, people who exhibited Duchenne smiles in their high school yearbook were half as likely to die.</p>
<p><strong>5. How we’re approached and our desire to be consistent affect our decisions.</strong></p>
<p>If I asked you to volunteer for an “Experiment at 7AM,” would you do it? What about a “7AM experiment”? 56% of people asked to volunteer for the first did so, but only 24% volunteered for a “7AM experiment”—fewer people want to wake up early, so the ordering of the words matters. In another experiment, some participants were called and asked if they would hypothetically volunteer for the American Cancer Society. When they were contacted a few days later and asked to volunteer, 31% agreed—versus 4% of people who were cold-called and asked to volunteer for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>6. We act differently when reminded of who we are.</strong></p>
<p>When participants were told that men and women scored differently on a particular test, female participants’ performance dropped dramatically. Male participants’ performance on a task dropped after interacting with an attractive female participant. When children are in a group on Halloween, they take more candy on average—but when children were singled out and asked their names, they took far less candy.</p>
<p><strong>7. Being watched sometimes helps—except when eating.</strong></p>
<p>Having an audience of people watching you complete a task improves performance on simple tasks but hinders performance on more complex tasks or when learning a new skill (they showed this with both humans and cockroaches—don’t ask). The mere presence of someone in the room causes this effect; even a repairman working on something in the corner slowed people down. Yet when it comes to eating, a full chicken will overeat in the presence of another chicken, and animals eat more in pairs than when alone.</p>
<p><strong>8. Comparing people to their friends is the most effective way to make them do something.</strong></p>
<p>When an electric company tried to encourage people to save energy at home, telling them “your neighbors are reducing their energy use” led to a 2% reduction in household usage. Telling people “save energy to save money” or “save energy to save the environment” did not decrease, and in some cases increased, energy usage.</p>
<p><strong>9. Context—where we do something—has a substantive effect on what we do.</strong></p>
<p>56% of actual voters voted for a pro-school budget when voting in a school vs. 53% otherwise. While that effect may not seem huge, it’s statistically significant and was reproduced in a lab environment (64% of people voted for a fake pro-school budget when shown pictures of a school vs. 56% who voted for it otherwise).</p>
<p><strong>10. The more you’re exposed to something, the more you like it—this is called the mere exposure effect, and it works in milliseconds.</strong></p>
<p>Participants shown a foreign word frequently were more likely to say the word had a positive connotation. The most immediate application of this effect is advertising; the more often you’re exposed to a commercial or ad, the more positively you will rate the company. Flashing images that elicit positive or negative emotions for only a few milliseconds subliminally conditions your attitude.</p>
<p>People liked familiar objects more than abstract patterns, but in both cases participants overwhelmingly preferred curved objects over objects with sharp edges. Objects in category C (featuring both curves and edges) fell in between.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>11. Curves &gt; Edges.</strong></p>
<p>Humans overwhelmingly prefer curved visual objects over objects with jagged lines.</p>
<p><strong>12. Don’t get hurt when there are a lot of people around you.</strong></p>
<p>Bystanders are less likely to intervene in a crime or help in an emergency as the number of observers increases, as each individual feels that someone else will help and responsibility is diffused. When a victim is bloody, people help less often—likely because there is a chance they would be exposed to pathogens. But victims who scream receive more help than those who don’t—clear and unambiguous danger is helped far more often than not.</p>
<p><strong>13. We really want to be happy, but being too happy can negatively affect our work.</strong></p>
<p>In a study of 10,000 participants from 48 different countries, happiness is rated as more important than any other personal outcome—more than finding meaning in life, becoming rich, or getting into heaven. Happy people more often label themselves as “curious,” and depressed people are more likely to notice small changes in facial expressions. Yet extremely happy people (9/10 or 10/10 on a happy scale) got worse grades and had lower salaries than moderately happy people (6/10, 7/10, or 8/10 on a happy scale).</p>
<p><strong>14. We do stupid things because we want to conform.</strong></p>
<p>In one study, a participant was placed in a group and asked to answer a seemingly simple question. The rest of the people in the group were all told to respond with the same incorrect answer to the question, after which the participant was asked to answer in front of the group. 37 of 50 participants gave the same incorrect answer as the rest of the group (even though it was very clearly wrong), either because they wanted to be “liked” by the group or because they thought the rest of the group was more informed than they. This effect was dampened by having just one other person in the group agree with the participant.</p>
<p><strong>15. We have trouble separating out traits in a person.</strong></p>
<p>Globally positive or negative reactions on a person (“he’s a nice guy”) affect our judgment of a person’s specific traits (“he’s attractive”). This is called the halo effect, and is particularly noticeable in celebrities; their attractiveness or fame also leads us to believe they’re intelligent, happy, or honest.</p>
<p><strong>16. We’re influenced by very particular types of rewards.</strong></p>
<p>Expected rewards reduce motivation on a task. Surprise rewards increase motivation on the same task. Fixed rewards are less powerful than performance-based rewards, even with creative tasks.</p>
<p><strong>17. Authority can fundamentally change our emotions and behavior.</strong></p>
<p>In the Stanford Prison experiment, participants were split into prisoners and guards and placed into a mock prison. In just six days (of a planned two weeks), the experiment had to be shut down because guards were harassing and abusing prisoners, and prisoners began showing signs of emotional breakdown.</p>
<p>65% of participants knowingly delivered a lethal dose of electricity to a participant (who they later learned was fake) simply because the instructor in the room told them to.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>18. Authority can also make us be obedient and do things to other people we could never imagine.</strong></p>
<p>In the famous Milgram experiment, participants were told to administer a shock of increasing strength when a participant in another room gave incorrect answers to a series of questions. About halfway through, the shocks were labeled “danger: severe shock” and a recording was played begging the experimenter to stop the experiment. Yet in 63% of cases, the participant administered the maximum shock, even when the person they thought they were administering a lethal dose of electric shock to another human being.</p>
<p>A recreation of the original Stanford Marshmallow experiment is predictably adorable. Longitudinal studies have shown that students who can resist eating the marshmallow are better behaved and get better grades later in life.</p>
<p><strong>19. Self-control at an early age might be indicative of success later in life.</strong></p>
<p>In the famous Stanford marshmallow experiment, a group of children participants were asked to wait in a room with a table full of marshmallows and cookies. If they wanted, they could have one treat now and the experiment would be over. Otherwise, if they could wait for the experimenter to return in a few minutes, they could have two treats. The children who couldn’t delay their urges—either they asked for the treat right away, or tried to sneakily eat a treat when the experimenter left—had more behavior problems, lower SAT scores, more trouble paying attention in school, and found it difficult to maintain friendships. In fact, a child who could wait 15 minutes scored 210 points higher on the SAT than children who could wait only 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>20. People aspire to round number goals.</strong></p>
<p>I tried to make this list 20 bullet points long instead of 19, and you do the same thing when trying to run 2.0 miles instead of 1.9. In Major League Baseball, players were four times as likely to end the season with a 0.300 batting average than 0.299. And when looking at over 4 million SAT scores, students who scored a 1290 were more likely to retake the test than students who scored a 1300—even though admissions offices did not statistically favor one score over the other.</p>

<p>I love New York City. It&rsquo;s home, but it&rsquo;s also a million cities in one. You can go from one neighborhood to another in a span of blocks, and sometimes that transition can be jarring.</p>
<p>If you want a taste of those neighborhoods, just drive down Madison Avenue. Let&rsquo;s start at 57th and Madison. Looking downtown, we get a glimpse of IBM&rsquo;s offices.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hw3us07TgRlk5pMC.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking uptown, we see Mont Blanc and Coach stores across the street from each other. The next 40 blocks are similar: store after store selling luxury goods.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2KnsGy-SiIMbvBDM.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At 96th and Madison, the transition gradually begins. These large apartment buildings are the last ones you&rsquo;ll see with penthouses for a while.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*-2OLSzsKM25WIKNV.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>At 98th and Madison, you reach a 3 block stretch of Mount Sinai hospital complexes.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*IN9hM62KBpQUnDgG.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When I was a kid, there were only 2 buildings. Slowly but surely, the hospital has bought whole blocks of the surrounding area and built a complex of emergency rooms, teaching hospitals, and doctors' offices.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fOl8XxfBxfgHrjSL.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At 102nd and Madison, construction on a beautiful new building that houses classrooms for Mt. Sinai&rsquo;s medical school just finished.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bwDJf0qiTE6qNt2a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That new medical school sits across the street from the George Washington Carver houses, one of the first project complexes you&rsquo;ll enter on the way into East Harlem.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*3mh6qGVxcoqTbWJ9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And at 103rd and Madison, you see a 1950s-era public school across the street from another low-income housing complex. It&rsquo;s the school I attended for nearly 8 years in elementary school, but more on that later.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Z9Gr2AZUgo9lU8dp.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no real 100th and Madison, since 100th Street never actually intersects Madison. But it acts as a sort of &ldquo;Platform 9 3/4,&rdquo; dividing two very different socioeconomic classes. It&rsquo;s a divide that shouldn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*JSINqcgqCzv5wMlT.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s paint a more convincing picture. Here is a map of the city&rsquo;s ethnic makeup based on the 2010 census, courtesy of the <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/census/2010/map"><em>New York Times</em></a>. Each dot represents 25 people. Green dots represent White New Yorkers, blue dots represent Black New Yorkers. Yellow dots represent Hispanics, red dots represent Asians, purple dots represent Native Americans, and grey dots represent &ldquo;other&rdquo;. See that line on the right side of the image where green ends and yellow begins? That&rsquo;s 98th street.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*kgLPCUtvwgf5hpEq.png" alt=""></p>
<p>How about a map of homicides from 2003-2011, also courtesy of the <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/crime/homicides/map"><em>New York Times</em></a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*pVyhDSQyg520cCEq.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Want a clearer picture? Here&rsquo;s a map of median income distribution from the 2010 census, courtesy of <a href="http://project.wnyc.org/acs2011/income.html"><em>WNYC</em></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*yYZzIsGP4nqeobzY.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At 96th St., median income is $184,583 +/- $75,883.</p>
<p>At 98th St., median income is $82,750 +/- $40,958.</p>
<p>At mythical 100th St. and the immediate area uptown, median income is $28,196 +/- $6,021.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s a $150,000 decrease of income potential in 4 blocks.</strong></p>
<p>The real issue is educational opportunity. Here is a graph of student performance, courtesy of the <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/new-york-schools-test-scores/"><em>New York Times</em></a>, at P.S. 77 Lower Lab, located at 96th Street and 3rd Avenue. P.S. 77 has 340 students total (K-8). 7% are &ldquo;poor,&rdquo; qualifying for the federal free lunch program. 92% of 3rd graders passed their state tests, 55% were advanced proficient, and only 5% were below standard.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*S0sXURcBOyoiY4pX.png" alt=""></p>
<p>P.S. 171&ndash;the school I attended from pre-kindergarten to 6th grade&ndash;is located at 103rd and Madison. It has 615 students total (K-8), 100% of whom qualify for federal free lunch. Of third graders, 64% passed their state tests, 24% were advanced proficient, and 2% were below standard.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TcgmWV9CkAxIic7D.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now for P.S. 146, located at 106th Street and 1st Avenue. It has 450 students, 88% of whom qualify for federal free lunch. <strong>Yet only 20% of third graders passed their state tests, 2% were advanced proficient, and 35% were below standard.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*xTYW05fnKPLOZ2DC.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is how cycles of poverty start. 3 schools, 3 very different educational outcomes.</p>
<p>A block can make a world of difference.</p>
