			 <p>The Wordpress and open source communities have lots of thoughts on Matt Mullenweg’s actions after his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnI-QcVSwMU">talk at WordCamp</a>. Much of this commentary has overlooked what I think is a core concern at the heart of Matt&rsquo;s argument: the growing role and influence of private equity in tech, particularly in open source.</p>
<p>PE firms raise money from institutional investors and high net worth individuals to buy companies, restructure them, and sell them later for a profit. They&rsquo;re all about maximizing returns ASAP, usually in a 3-7 year window. That&rsquo;s a shorter timeframe than the typical founder or public company shareholder, and far shorter than <a href="https://tim.blog/2024/01/02/matt-mullenweg-2-transcript/">Matt&rsquo;s time horizon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like future generations to grow up with a web that is more open, more free, gives more liberty, and so open source is really my life’s work, even above WordPress and anything else. I hope to work on it the rest of my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a PE firm acquires a tech company, a few things happen. The new owners focus on aggressive cost-cutting and &ldquo;streamlining&rdquo; operations to boost short-term profitability. This is extremely destructive, leading to mass layoffs, reduced benefits, and wholesale outsourcing. At the same time, PE firms often load up acquired companies with debt, extracting cash while leaving the businesses more financially unstable. With a myopic focus on an exit, long-term investments in innovation, customer service, and employee development fall by the wayside.</p>
<p><strong>The result? Private equity backed companies are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3423290">10 times more likely</a> to go bankrupt than public companies.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic business model of private equity firms often leads to disasters like that at ManorCare for three fundamental reasons. First, private equity firms typically buy businesses only for the short term. Second, they often load up the companies they buy with debt and extract onerous fees. And third, they insulate themselves from the consequences, both legal and financial, of their actions. This leads to a practice of extraction, rather than investment, of destruction, rather than creation. While not every company owned by private equity firms goes bankrupt, the chance of disaster meaningfully increases under their ownership.<br>
— <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/21/books/review/plunder-brendan-ballou-these-are-the-plunderers-gretchen-morgenson-joshua-rosner.html"><em>Plunder</em> by Brendan Ballou</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Open source communities are particularly vulnerable to this model. They’re delicate ecosystems of volunteer contributors, transparent governance, and values-aligned sponsorships. Applying the PE playbook can easily destabilize that entire balance.</p>
<p>Take, for example, Vista Equity Partners' $1 billion acquisition of Acquia in 2019. Acquia is the main commercial backer of Drupal, another popular open source CMS. In the years since the acquisition, the Drupal community has visibly struggled. Acquia appears to be contributing less code and providing less financial support to the ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Just a few days ago, Acquia <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexmorenolopez_acquia-drupal-layoffs-activity-7247196514396102658-e8Dt">quietly laid off</a> <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blanksforever/post/DArFDFsSiiu">almost a third</a> <a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/Employee-Review-Acquia-RVW90841435.htm">of its staff</a>.</strong></p>
<p>With fewer resources, core development and maintenance have slowed. This coincides with a <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/Drupal">sharp decline in Drupal&rsquo;s market share</a> compared to competitors like WordPress:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-10-07-at-15.51.452x.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Drupal story demonstrates how applying PE tactics to open source projects can undermine their health and sustainability. By nature, these communities aren&rsquo;t a fit for rapid extraction of outsized returns. Their vitality depends on reinvestment, transparency, and long-term stability — the opposite of the PE model.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/toys-r-us-bankruptcy-private-equity/561758/">Toys “R” Us</a>. <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/08/simon-and-schuster-kkr-paramount-global-book-publishing">Simon &amp; Schuster</a>. Even <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/04/private-equity-ports-strike-dockworker">America’s ports</a>. Not everyone can push back against private equity, but I believe we should support companies like Wordpress that have a long history of admirable values and prescient leadership. Wordpress powers more than 40% of the web — its community’s health is too important to ignore.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zmh.org/2024/08/04/installing-commaai-on.html">Installing Comma.ai on a 2018 Mazda CX-5</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zmh.org/2024/08/04/installing-commaai-on.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-04 21:31:02 -0500">Aug 4, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently ordered a <a href="https://comma.ai/">Comma.ai</a> kit to add semi-autonomous driving capabilities to my 2018 Mazda CX-5. It took some trial and error (and help from the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/FEzeve2NX2">Comma.ai community on Discord</a>) to get it working properly, but I <em>highly</em> recommend it as I’ll explain later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing the steps I took in case it&rsquo;s helpful for others looking to install the Comma 3X on the same or a similar vehicle. It&rsquo;s a pretty intuitive process, all things considered, but there weren’t a lot of guides with photos on how to do the actual installation process.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="a-false-start">A false start</h2>
<p>When I initially received the Comma 3X kit and installed it (follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV7_Su4xbzs">installation video</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@to.jafar/how-to-setup-openpilot-on-mazda-3eb54c62fdc5">Jafar&rsquo;s post</a>, it&rsquo;s pretty simple) I thought I’d be up and running quickly. However, the device seemed stuck in dashcam mode and didn&rsquo;t move the steering wheel at all. After digging into the Discord server and reading more, it appeared to be an issue with fingerprinting my specific Mazda model.</p>
<p>I reset the device and installed a <a href="https://smiskol.com/fork/jafaral/mazda-0.9.6">special fork</a> I found on the Discord server which had more Mazda car fingerprints to help identify how to interface with the car. This worked on a test drive, but the car would beep aggressively every 5 seconds if you weren&rsquo;t holding the wheel very deliberately, making highway driving difficult. Even without Comma installed the car would complain when you had cruise control enabled and weren’t holding the steering wheel in the right place, but adding the Comma made it complain much more.</p>
<p>The Discord community <a href="https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/533836721541087242/628249300555792394">recommends</a> trying a wheel cover with weights underneath, which worked somewhat but was quite bulky. Ultimately, I decided to pursue the ultimate solution I had been trying to avoid: swapping out the EPS motor.</p>
<h2 id="swapping-the-eps-motor">Swapping the EPS motor</h2>
<p>The EPS motor on pre-2022 Mazdas is designed for very lightweight lane departure vibrations. I always thought it felt a bit underpowered, and you could feel the car lightly bouncing between the lane markers. On any serious turn, the car would just continue to depart the lane.</p>
<p>Newer Mazda EPS motors can apply more torque to the wheel, allowing for real LKAS (lane keep assistance) that can turn the car even through 10+ degree curves. I was initially hesitant to replace the EPS motor because I wasn&rsquo;t sure exactly where it was located. But after reading the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/533836721541087242/1250213678108905574">pinned messages</a> on Discord and asking a few questions, the community reassured me it was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>The process ended up being easier than I anticipated, although there were a few tricky parts. Here&rsquo;s a detailed breakdown of how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Order the new EPS motor from eBay — the LKQ store has several options, but you have to make sure the vehicle is model year 2022 or higher. As an example, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_dkr=1&amp;iconV2Request=true&amp;_blrs=recall_filtering&amp;_ssn=lkqonline&amp;store_cat=0&amp;store_name=lkqonline&amp;_oac=1&amp;_nkw=2023%20mazda%20cx-5%20power%20steering%20pump%20oem">here&rsquo;s a search</a> on LKQ&rsquo;s eBay store, or just look for &ldquo;2023 Mazda CX-5 Power Steering Pump OEM&rdquo;. You’ll also need a 10mm and 12mm wrench for later.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll receive a hunk of metal similar to this. The only part needed is the circular gearbox-looking piece on the left of this picture.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8387.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Remove the two bolts pictured here, which will detach the shaft from the EPS motor. Use a 12mm wrench for these and be careful not to lose the small plastic gear in the center of the motor once you remove it.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-08-04-at-21.31.512x.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWTWZWl6Lgc">Disconnect your car battery</a> using a 10mm wrench to prevent the airbags from firing.</li>
<li>While not required, I recommend removing the cover to the left of the steering wheel. It pops out easily and improves access to the EPS motor.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8393.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Now that you’re in, you’ll see the same motor mounted, as pictured here:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8395.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Here&rsquo;s the trickiest part: you need to remove the same two bolts on the old gearbox, but one bolt is close to a piece of metal, making it hard to fit the wrench in. It&rsquo;s doable but will take a few attempts. Both bolts are on quite tight, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to use some force to loosen them.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8398.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8399.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Once the bolts are out, unhook the 3 cables at the top and detach the old motor.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8401.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>One tip: the small gear kept falling out or misaligning as I tried to install the new motor. Rather than fumbling with alignment, I positioned the gear on the other (already mounted) side so it was already lined up correctly. You’ll see what I mean.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.zmh.org/uploads/2024/img-8409.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Screw the bolts back in, reconnect your battery, and you&rsquo;re all set! You&rsquo;ll want to install <a href="https://smiskol.com/fork/jafaral/mazda-eps22-swap">this modified fork</a> on the Comma 3X, which tells older Mazdas to use the new EPS motor.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>After installing the new EPS motor, I&rsquo;ve been <em>really</em> impressed with its performance. I wouldn&rsquo;t even bother installing Comma.ai on an older Mazda without it — the experience is just too annoying otherwise.</p>
<p>The upgraded EPS motor enables stop-and-go adaptive cruise control, which by itself is a fantastic improvement for city traffic. It also provides LKAS that keeps the car smoothly centered in the lane without any warnings to keep your hands on the wheel. These enhancements make long drives much more pleasant.</p>
<p>With the new motor, I&rsquo;ve completed a few hundred-mile road trips with only three or four interventions to assist with turning, and just a handful of additional interventions in busy city traffic. It really is quite capable.</p>
<p>Since I had Comma installed before the EPS motor upgrade, I spent some time observing the Openpilot lane markings as we drove. There was never a point where the green outline indicating the car&rsquo;s projected path was misdirected or where the detected lane markers deviated from reality. I also drove at night and in the rain, with no issues whatsoever. This gave me a lot of confidence in the system&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the Comma team for building an incredible hardware product, and to all the maintainers of <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">Openpilot</a> and volunteers in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/FEzeve2NX2">#Mazda Discord channel</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote this post a week ago and have been thinking hard about whether I believe the premise, which is that within a few years, the norm for source code will be that it is written and modified by LLMs via prompting. For all practical purposes, all source code will be written this way, with exceptions becoming ever rarer.</p>
<p>Not only do I believe it, I could even see it happening in 12-18 months at the current rate of LLM progress. I think the change will have a ton of fallout, only some of it foreseeable. And one casualty might well be junior devs, in the sense that they become less marketable and it could cause various kinds of crunches across the industry.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>But change is coming. There will be social and cultural upheaval in tech, just as is happening in the legal profession. It&rsquo;s already begun. The models are getting smarter and smarter with each passing month, which means they are going to be eating more and more jobs until they eat the world.</p>
<p>All I can tell you is this: Get there early. One time Googlers were complaining at TGIF that the parking garage was filling up by midmorning, and Larry Page jokingly suggested, &ldquo;Maybe you should come earlier.&rdquo; At that moment he reeked of billionaire. But if you really wanted to park in the garage, you took his advice.</p>
<p>Get good, fast. That&rsquo;s what you need to do. Get ahead of the slackers while our industry turns upside down, and you might be the one to survive.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t over-index on programming language arcana. That&rsquo;s becoming a detail that machines handle for us. Focus on algorithms, data structures, software design and engineering, discrete math, operating systems, compilers, databases, networks. Focus on studying real systems. Find walkthroughs online and study them. And of course ML. Gobble up everything you can.</p>
<p>Understand how things are built. Make sure you know how every system in a computer works. Make sure you have an understanding of how every cloud service you depend on does its job. Read the docs, and then read the design docs. You won&rsquo;t have to write any of it by hand. But you need to develop a senior programmer&rsquo;s sensibilities around how these things fit together and interact, for good or ill.</p>
<p>Learn how to use frontier models to check other LLM models' work. Sign up for multiple services (e.g. Claude and ChatGPT) and send your important prompts to at least two big models. Have them evaluate each other&rsquo;s responses and study it all carefully. LLMs are better at reviewing and critiquing their own content than they are at producing it. So use a second LLM as your senior partner.</p>
<p>Another one of the key things that differentiates a senior developer from a junior one, in many contexts, is Operations experience. Read the O&rsquo;Reilly/Google SRE book. Read it cover to cover. And find a good GitOps book, too; there seem to be quite a few to choose from. There may be no compression algorithm for experience, but fortunately a lot of that experience has been condensed and distilled. Go drink it up.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what approach you take, as long as you start making heavy use of chat in programming. Because that, friendo, is how it works now. Like it or not. And you need to survive it. Good luck to you.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important insight NASA has gleaned from studying team dynamics—in space and on Earth—is the preciousness of one trait in particular: a sense of humour.

But the most important task by far is that of the clown, a person who is funny and also wise enough to understand each member of the group and defuse tensions.</p>

<p>From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you don’t take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you’ll be ignored so you know the importance of listening to others, and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these things or not, they’re going to happen. And whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The last bit of advice I’ll give you is very simple, but I think it could make a big difference in your life. Once a week, you should write a note to someone. Not an email. A note on a piece of paper. It will take you exactly 10 minutes. Talk to an adult, let them tell you what a stamp is. You can put the stamp on the envelope. Again, 10 minutes, once a week. I will help you, right now. I will dictate to you the first note you should write. It will say, ‘Dear [fill in the name of a teacher at Cardigan Mountain School].’ Say: ‘I have started at this new school. We are reading [blank] in English. Football or soccer practice is hard, but I’m enjoying it. Thank you for teaching me.’ Put it in an envelope, put a stamp on it and send it. It will mean a great deal to people who — for reasons most of us cannot contemplate — have dedicated themselves to teaching middle school boys. As I said, that will take you exactly 10 minutes a week. By the end of the school year, you will have sent notes to 40 people. Forty people will feel a little more special because you did, and they will think you are very special because of what you did. No one else is going to carry that dividend during your time at school.</p>

The little bars that show it literally is over 200%, you just should ship this yesterday.” The data looked really good.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a Moccamaster for the past two years and love the way it makes coffee. Choosing a model was relatively hard though, since they have multiple options and models. A few friends have asked how I picked a model, so I wanted to share the 3 main decisions you&rsquo;ll need to make:</p>
<h3 id="1-glass-vs-stainless-steel-carafe">1. Glass vs. stainless steel carafe</h3>
<p>Stainless steel pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower chance of breaking</li>
<li>Will keep coffee warmer by itself longer (e.g. taking the carafe to the kitchen table)</li>
</ul>
<p>Stainless steel cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harder to clean since it’s not dishwasher safe and the mouth is narrower</li>
<li>Some people are sensitive to the taste that stainless steel imparts to coffee</li>
</ul>
<p>Glass pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Dishwasher safe and easy to clean by hand</li>
<li>No aftertaste</li>
</ul>
<p>Glass cons</p>
<ul>
<li>All the glass carafe models have a hotplate to keep the coffee warm, which means there are a few more parts that could break over time</li>
<li>Easier to break, though it seems quite strong</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-10-cup-vs-8-cup">2. 10 cup vs. 8 cup</h3>
<p>For anything more than 1 person, would definitely get the 10 cup. The “cups” are European sizes (4oz), and  we go through one 10 cup pot easily. Plus, you can easily make less than 10 cups if you don’t need a full carafe.</p>
<h3 id="3-manual-drip-stop-vs-auto-drip-stop">3. Manual drip stop vs auto drip stop</h3>
<p>Manual drip stop has a switch that controls how quickly coffee leaves the brew basket into the carafe. You can close it completely to steep for longer, put it halfway to let it brew more slowly, or open fully to get a weaker cup. We keep ours on half speed all the time and that seems to work really well. Auto dripstop works as soon as you remove the carafe, which is easier but means you don’t have as much control with coffee strength etc.</p>
<p>Manual dripstop pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Can adjust how strong your coffee is</li>
</ul>
<p>Manual dripstop cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing carafe midway through brew is harder — need to fully close the brew basket, use carafe, and then reopen the brew basket</li>
<li>You can easily forget to reopen brew basket, which will overflow if you don’t. (We’ve gotten close to this a few times when absentmindedly making coffee in the morning).</li>
<li>The mechanism is a bit finicky</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few other differences, but basically once you decide on those 3, there’s 1-2 models to choose from.</p>
<p>Ultimately I chose <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0798B6HFY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">this model</a> with glass carafe / 10 cup / manual drip stop — in the future, I might choose the automatic drip stop since it&rsquo;s a bit easier for guests to figure out if they want to make coffee.</p>
<h3 id="other-resources">Other resources</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.beanpoet.com/which-moccamaster-should-i-buy/">https://www.beanpoet.com/which-moccamaster-should-i-buy/</a></li>
<li>The water pouring spout has so-so water distribution by default — new models have <a href="https://us.moccamaster.com/products/outlet-arm-9-holes">this new spout</a> but you can also buy it separately for older models or there are third party options like <a href="https://www.artisansmith.com.au/products/shower-head-for-moccamaster">this</a> and <a href="https://coffeepilot.ca/products/shower-head-insert-for-technivorm-moccamaster">this</a> that spread the water more evenly</li>
<li>Moccamaster recommends using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Urnex-Espresso-Machine-Cleaner-Cleancaf/dp/B000FDDU8G/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1XGR8ZP63XC8O&amp;keywords=descaler+moccamaster&amp;qid=1669592778&amp;sprefix=descaler+moccamast%2Caps%2C123&amp;sr=8-6">this descaler</a> every few weeks - I use it once a quarter with good results</li>

<p>Swappable batteries were introduced mid year, so not all models include them.

			 <p><em>This post was originally published on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Forbes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Seeking Alpha in 2015.</em></p>
<p>While only four states—Nevada, California, Florida, and Michigan—have allowed driverless cars on public roads, many experts agree that self-driving cars could be used in controlled environments like highways by 2020. And <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/would-you-buy-a-self-driving-car/">a study</a> of 2,000 drivers found that more than 75% of Americans would consider buying a self-driving car.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take it as a given that cars will get increasingly automated over the next few decades. Are there publicly traded companies—auto makers, tech firms, manufacturers, or infrastructure providers—that are well-positioned to capitalize on this huge shift in transportation?</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I do not currently own shares in any of these stocks, but plan to buy some due to my research. I will update this post if and when I do buy shares in any of the below.</em></p>

<h3 id="google-nasdaqgoog">Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)</h3>
<p>From both a hardware and software IP perspective, Google has the largest head start in this space. They&rsquo;ve started building 100 adorable two-seaters and will begin testing them by early next year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear whether Google intends to make their own cars or license their technology. In any event, they have been granted one patent so far (<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/8078349">&ldquo;Transitioning a mixed-mode vehicle to autonomous mode&rdquo;</a>) and four more pending: <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20110182475.PGNR.">Traffic Signal Mapping and Detection</a>, <a href="http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220120083964%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20120083964&amp;RS=DN/20120083964">Zone Driving</a>, <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20120083959.PGNR.">Diagnosis and Repair for Autonomous Vehicles</a>, and <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20120083960.PGNR.">System and Method for Predicting Behaviors of Detected Objects</a>.</p>
<h3 id="audi-etrnsu">Audi (ETR:NSU)</h3>
<p>Audi was the second company granted a license to test autonomous cars in Nevada (Google was first). Their research car, a collaboration with Stanford University, autonomously completed a 13-mile, 156-turn circuit in 27 minutes. At the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show, it debuted a vehicle that can drive without human intervention at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. Last weekend, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/audi-rs7-driverless-car-hits-the-race-track-2014-10">an Audi autonomous car drove</a> unassisted on a German racetrack, hitting 140 miles an hour at one point. They&rsquo;re also working on a self-parking system that will allow drivers to exit a vehicle and let a car find a parking spot on its own. <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/509676/audi-shrinks-the-autonomous-car/">Audi executives predict</a> Japan would be the first market to see such features in their cars, adding that &ldquo;the traffic and parking situation in Japan is quite outstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="mercedes-benz-etrdai">Mercedes-Benz (ETR:DAI)</h3>
<p>Mercedes already has partial-automated driving features on the Mercedes-Benz E and S-Class models. It hopes to have a fully autonomous version of its S-class sedan by 2020. At CES this year, it <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/mercedes-unveils-self-driving-pollution-free-car-ces-2015-297160">unveiled</a> a radical new driverless car prototype.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also committed to making autonomous trucks—it hopes to have a fully-autonomous truck on the road by 2025, and has already run tests of an autonomous truck on the German Autobahn. According to Daimler board member Dr. Wolfgang Bernhard, &ldquo;the truck of the future is a Mercedes-Benz that drives itself. The Future Truck 2025 is our response to the major challenges and opportunities associated with road freight transport in the future.&rdquo; In many ways, driverless trucks are likely to happen sooner than driverless cars. <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/6/3/5775482/why-trucks-will-drive-themselves-before-cars-do">Vox lists out the reasons why</a>.</p>

<h3 id="flexray-protocol-companies-freescale-semiconductor-nysefsl-and-nxp-semiconductors-nasdaqnxpi">FlexRay Protocol Companies: Freescale Semiconductor (NYSE:FSL) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI)</h3>
<p>According to a <a href="http://electronics360.globalspec.com/article/4289/google-s-driverless-car-to-boost-chip-revenue">new report</a> covered by the <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/driverless-cars-a-bonanza-for-chipmakers">IEEE</a>, driverless car-compliant microcontroller and processor units will be a $500 million market by 2020, up from $69 million last year. These units will likely conform to the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlexRay">FlexRay</a> data protocol, created by a (now defunct) consortium of companies who create electronics for driverless cars. It&rsquo;s 10-times faster than the current <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus">CAN</a> messaging protocol used in cars, and is safer since it has two independent messaging channels.</p>
<p>Freescale Semiconductor is <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/10/making-the-autonomous-car-a-reality-getting-drivers-ready-is-half-the-battle/">already a thought leader</a> in the space, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/freescale/posts/10152189081919186">leading conferences</a> and <a href="http://en.espnf1.com/blogs/motorsport/story/180563.html">partnering with Formula One</a> to investigate potential partnerships. More importantly, it&rsquo;s already trusted by car manufacturers. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-30/intel-chases-sales-on-silicon-road-to-driverless-cars.html">According to Mike O&rsquo;Brien</a>, a U.S.-based VP of product planning for Hyundai, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t get a beta test with our products—they have to work from the first one,&rdquo; explaining the company&rsquo;s cautious approach to chips in its cars.</p>
<p>NXP is also a leader in the chip space, having <a href="https://gigaom.com/2013/01/04/cisco-nxp-invest-in-autonomous-car-startup-cohda/">co-invested with Cisco</a> in a startup that lets cars &ldquo;see&rdquo; around corners.</p>
<h3 id="mobileye-nysembly">Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY)</h3>
<p>Mobileye&rsquo;s IPO two months ago was the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/mobileye-soars-in-trading-debut-1406905106">best performing</a> U.S. IPO since Twitter. Their technology senses obstructions and lanes, and can alert drivers of a collision. <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1607310/000157104914003550/t1401453-424b4.htm">Their prospectus</a> made clear they intend to be a leader in this space:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our sophisticated software algorithms and proprietary EyeQ® system on a chip (&ldquo;SoC&rdquo;) combine high performance, low energy consumption and low cost, with automotive-grade standards to provide drivers with interpretations of a scene in real-time and an immediate evaluation based on the analysis. Our products use monocular camera processing that works accurately alone, or together with radar for redundancy. We expect to launch products that work with multi-focal cameras for automated driving applications with the same high performance, low energy consumption and low cost starting in 2016.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/08/14/analyst-says-mobileye-well-poised-for-autonomous-vehicle-trend/">RBC Capital Markets predicts</a> the company will &ldquo;experience hyper growth through the end of the decade&rdquo; with a compound annual growth rate of near 50%, adding that Mobileye is the &ldquo;only real &lsquo;pure-play&rsquo; for investors looking for ADAS and autonomous driving exposure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, there are downsides to the stock. Mobileye <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/heard-on-the-street-mobileyes-stock-on-collision-course-1412963651">currently trades at 190-times forward earnings</a>, and Goldman Sachs downgraded their rating to &ldquo;Neutral&rdquo;. After Tesla announced that Mobileye will power the autopilot feature on its Model S cars, Mobileye stock dropped ~27%.</p>
<h3 id="stmicroelectronics-nysestm">STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM)</h3>
<p>Who makes Mobileye&rsquo;s chips? STMicroelectronics. They&rsquo;re the <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?t=1&amp;item=VHlwZT0yfFBhcmVudElEPTM3OTIwNzF8Q2hpbGRJRD00MjgwNDA=">leading</a> automotive semiconductor company, and while it&rsquo;s unclear what their relationship will be with Mobileye, Google, and carmakers, they have the infrastructure to manufacture chips on a level few others do. <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/932787/000119312514084249/d622882d20f.htm#tx622882_6">And in 2013</a>, &ldquo;revenues increased 3.2%, a better performance than the [Serviceable Addressable Market], with the main contributions coming from microcontrollers and automotive products.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="nokia-nysenok">Nokia (NYSE:NOK)</h3>
<p>After Nokia sold its mobile phone division to Microsoft for $7.5 billion earlier this year, it&rsquo;s a far leaner company with a very relevant core competency: mapping.</p>
<p>The Nokia HERE division owns map data that originally belonged to Navteq. HERE Maps use 80,000+ data sources including cars on the ground that collect data through panoramic cameras, laser technology for 3D views, LIDAR sensors, and high-resolution cameras that capture street name signs and speed limits. That division also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/nokia-steps-up-in-its-mapping-quest-buys-earthmine-for-3d-street-level-imaging/">acquired</a> Berkeley-based Earthmine. <a href="http://360.here.com/2013/10/28/bigger-mapping-maps-nokia-lumia-2520/">Nokia HERE already powers</a> 4 out of 5 cars with in-dash navigation systems.</p>
<p>Nokia HERE has 90% market share for embedded automotive maps and its <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20140721/OEM06/307219954/the-vision-for-self-driving-cars?-2020">VP of connected driving says</a> Nokia is building a map database specifically for driverless cars. Post-spinoff, Nokia is now a lean map company that will be a prime partner for many car companies, or an acquisition target for a company like Google looking to beef up its mapping IP.</p>
<h3 id="delphi-automotive-nysedlph">Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH)</h3>
<p>Delphi is a spinoff of General Motors that is now one of the largest automotive part manufacturers. Although its <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/14/automobiles/delphi-says-autonomous-cars-are-coming-but-only-in-bits-and-pieces.html?_r=0">CEO has warned</a> driverless cars might be further off than people realize, he has also promised that the company will build parts and sensors whether cars are 10%, 80%, or 100% autonomous.</p>
<h3 id="autoliv-nysealv">Autoliv (NYSE:ALV)</h3>
<p><a href="http://autoliv.com/">Autoliv</a> manufactures a variety of car safety sensors, including cameras that can detect pedestrians, a night vision camera that can detect upcoming obstacles, and a smart seat belt that can restrain passengers even before a collision occurs. Their radar systems are <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1034670/000119312514158776/d694785d10q.htm#tx694785_13">already in higher-end cars</a>.</p>

<h3 id="trucking-jb-hunt-nasdaqjbht">Trucking: J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.valueline.com/Stocks/Industries/Industry_Analysis__Trucking.aspx#.VDxIHRPF-yo">Labor</a> is one of trucking&rsquo;s highest expenses—the supply of qualified drivers is limited, and companies need to offer high wages, pensions, and workers' compensation to lure candidates. J.B.

			 <h3 id="citymapper-is-what-happens-when-you-actually-understand-user-experience">Citymapper is what happens when you actually understand user experience.</h3>
<p><em>This post was originally published on Medium in 2014.</em></p>
<p>Every so often, an app comes along that just completely understands the way you think. I don&rsquo;t normally write long posts about an app I&rsquo;ve used. But <a href="https://citymapper.com/apps">Citymapper</a> is so incredibly well-made that I decided to put together a list of common use cases of a maps app, and how both Google Maps and Citymapper handle them.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-1-i-need-to-get-somewhere-as-fast-as-possible">Scenario 1: I need to get somewhere as fast as possible.</h3>
<p><strong>Citymapper, 10 seconds:</strong> I can see all 4 options (public transport, walking, car/taxi, and biking) side-by-side, allowing me to compare options quickly.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rcRs1zoyDlpeiIHYvVl0DA.gif" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Google Maps, 20 seconds:</strong> I need to click through each individual option and remember which is the fastest. Also, the flyover animation is cool but unnecessary when I&rsquo;m trying to see what the fastest time is.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hkur1KvTKj3lZ6BYJD1FWA.gif" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="scenario-2-i-want-to-see-the-time-needed-to-get-from-point-a-to-point-b">Scenario 2: I want to see the time needed to get from point A to point B.</h3>
<p><strong>Citymapper, 10 seconds:</strong> I can enter my origin and destination at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/104647312">View video demonstration</a></p>
<p><strong>Google Maps, 30 seconds:</strong> I need to first enter my destination, then specify how I want to get there, and then change my origin from &ldquo;My Location&rdquo; to a different address.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/104646636">View video demonstration</a></p>
<h3 id="scenario-3-what-are-the-trains-near-me">Scenario 3: What are the trains near me?</h3>
<p><strong>Citymapper, 2 seconds:</strong> Since I know the subway system pretty well, I don&rsquo;t always need full directions &mdash; I just need to know where the closest subways are so I can judge which one I should take. With one click on the train icon, I can see all the trains near me, sorted by distance. Same thing for buses.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/104645129">View video demonstration</a></p>
<p><strong>Google Maps, 30+ seconds:</strong> There&rsquo;s no way to see all nearby trains, so you have to manually look around your waypoint and click on each station. There <em>is</em> a public transit option in the sidenav, but it only highlights the lines on the map and you still need to click through to see which stations are closest. And at transit hubs (in this case, Union Square) it considers different subway entrances and lines as separate, so it won&rsquo;t let you see aggregate information for a particular station.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/104648027">View video demonstration</a></p>
<h3 id="scenario-4-how-long-will-it-take-me-to-get-somewhere-by-citibike">Scenario 4: How long will it take me to get somewhere by Citibike?</h3>
<p><strong>Google Maps, can&rsquo;t do it:</strong> Google Maps doesn&rsquo;t have bikeshare integration, so I&rsquo;m forced to switch apps and use the equally scatterbrained Citibike app to find availability.</p>
<p><strong>Citymapper, 15 seconds:</strong> Not only does Citymapper find where the nearest Citibike location is and let me choose whether I want the fastest route or the quietest (read: safest) route, <strong>it also notices that the closest Citibike location to my destination has no available spaces and reroutes me to the next closest one that does.</strong> <em>That&rsquo;s magical.</em></p>

<h3 id="scenario-5-i-just-searched-for-directions-at-the-office-and-now-i-want-to-see-those-directions-again">Scenario 5: I just searched for directions at the office, and now I want to see those directions again.</h3>
<p><strong>Citymapper, 5 seconds:</strong> Previously searched destinations can be found right underneath the search bar for easy access.</p>

<p><strong>Google Maps, 10 seconds &mdash; if you know where to find it:</strong> For some reason, previously searched destinations are found under your profile (the person icon next to the search bar) instead of when I search. I never noticed that until I started writing this post.</p>

<p>In any other app, shaking my phone might mean &ldquo;undo last action&rdquo; (e.g. Mailbox) or &ldquo;submit feedback&rdquo; (e.g. some beta builds of mobile apps). In a <em>maps</em> app, though, there&rsquo;s pretty much one thing a shaking phone means &mdash; I&rsquo;m running, biking, or just moving. And when I do any of that with Google Maps, this happens:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*J6mzyvy6COoSVAatynNZKA.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>It blocks my view, it shuts off turn-by-turn directions, and is altogether a pretty terrible interaction.</p>
<h2 id="other-design-details">Other design details</h2>
<h3 id="city-icons">City icons</h3>
<p>Going to a different city? Citymapper&rsquo;s customized icons for each of its supported metro areas gives the app personality.</p>

<h3 id="offline-subway-map">Offline subway map</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the subway, you can access a full offline zoomable subway map by clicking on an icon on the homescreen. They also have a &ldquo;Save trips&rdquo; option on the directions screen so you can save directions for offline use (e.g. on a subway).</p>

<h3 id="humor">Humor</h3>
<p>First, their release notes are legitimately funny (see Twitter examples).</p>
<p>And when presenting your transit options, Citymapper will occasionally throw in a funny option:</p>

<p>or sometimes:</p>

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*p80s_ZS0lYwpO_XLQz1FAA.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>But I guess I&rsquo;m easily amused.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Citymapper is more thoughtfully designed for urban travel. But for people who drive cars, something like Waze &mdash; with its fullscreen interface and crowdsourced realtime information &mdash; is a better choice.</p>
<p>And there are still features I would love to have in Citymapper. Turn-by-turn directions. Spoken directions for when I&rsquo;m on a Citibike. Maybe personalized time estimates that are tailored to my walking, running, and biking speeds. But whatever Citymapper adds to the app in the coming months, I know it will be thoughtfully engineered and designed to make finding directions almost <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re so inclined, you can <a href="https://citymapper.com/apps">download Citymapper here</a>. (And disclaimer: I have no relation to Citymapper. Just a happy user. They didn&rsquo;t even know I was writing this post.)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><em>This post was originally published on Medium in 2014.</em></p>
<p>Ask any Mac power user about their menubar and you&rsquo;ll get a different list of 5-10 must-have applications and utilities that boost productivity. The menubar is the mission control of a user&rsquo;s computer, giving them an at-a-glance view of stats and apps that are important to them. The menubar can become so crowded, in fact, that&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.macbartender.com/">menubar app</a> that collects menubar apps. So meta.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9G9kExA8or0zhslGdTdmew.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="history-of-the-menubar-app">History of the Menubar App</h3>
<p>As far as I can tell, the first menubar app appeared in the 2002 release of Mac OS X 10.2, nicknamed Jaguar. Apple had just released iChat, and part of the iChat interface was the ability to change your availability status from the menubar. But as Mac Developer Ari Weinstein has pointed out in a note, &ldquo;NSStatusItem, the API developers use to create menu items, has existed since OS X 10.0 (or longer, it probably originated as part of Rhapsody in the late &rsquo;90s).&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XyR7zeH6E61HO_ya_-qDWw.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FNR_su3myAo7koDzSCwRkA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By 2005 and the release of OS X 10.4 Tiger, other apps began to use the menubar interface to expose app status, preferences, and frequently-used features.</p>
<hr>
<p>The menubar is a uniquely restrictive interface. Animations on the menubar icon can be distracting, but can also be a useful status indicator. Windows aren&rsquo;t persistent, so you can&rsquo;t count on the user keeping the window open as they multitask.</p>
<p>In short, menubar apps face unique design constraints. Let&rsquo;s take a look at 15 apps with a menubar presence&mdash; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caffeine/id411246225?mt=12">Caffeine</a>, <a href="http://layervault.com">Layervault</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skitch-snap.-mark-up.-share./id425955336?mt=12">Skitch</a>, <a href="https://justgetflux.com/">F.lux</a>, <a href="https://cloudup.com/">Cloudup</a>, <a href="http://www.code42.com/crashplan/">Crashplan</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id443987910?mt=12">1Password</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one/id422304217?mt=12">Day One</a>, <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cloud/id417602904?mt=12">Cloudapp</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote/id406056744?mt=12">Evernote</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/droplr/id498672703?mt=12">Droplr</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-calendar-reminders/id435003921?mt=12">Fantastical</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mint-quickview/id533491939?mt=12">Mint</a>.</p>
<h3 id="window-dimensions">Window dimensions</h3>
<p>The sizes and aspect ratios of 15 top menubar apps range pretty significantly:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EWWNVGlp9HDr_K_1lnXrzQ.gif" alt="Width by height of various menubar apps, and their aspect ratios (width / height)"></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R3yuxYQR-Y0Qj3udNnFIRw.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an entirely fair comparison, however, since not all the apps are stateful. Some (like Caffeine) are glorified context menus, while others (like Mint) display changing information and allow users to interact with the app. If we remove Caffeine, Skitch, Layervault, and F.lux, we get a good estimate of the ratio of width:height for full-blown menubar apps.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*E24I3LD4Z_elORYzNepRpA.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="resource-usage">Resource Usage</h3>
<p>A few things about my process here &mdash; these metrics were taken on a Late 2013 Retina Macbook Pro running OS X 10.9.4 with Activity Monitor 10 minutes after a fresh restart (to deal with any usage spikes immediately after a restart). None of the apps were doing active work (e.g. Dropbox wasn&rsquo;t syncing any files). I only took metrics for the &ldquo;helper&rdquo; process if the menubar app was an interface for a larger app (e.g. Evernote and Skitch have separate app and menubar processes). And I excluded Twitter because it doesn&rsquo;t have a separate menubar process and it didn&rsquo;t seem fair to include the entire app&rsquo;s usage in the comparison. Obviously some of these stats will depend on your system, hardware, OS, etc.</p>

<h3 id="quit-with-q">Quit with ⌘Q?</h3>
<p>Only 5 of the 15 apps (Cloudup, Cloudapp, Droplr, Fantastical, Mint) listed allow users to quit the app by pressing ⌘+Q while the menubar app is enabled.</p>

<h3 id="icon-interactivity">Icon interactivity</h3>
<p>Most of the menubar apps have an icon that animates or changes color (i.e. the Dropbox icon when files are syncing). Only 4 don&rsquo;t&mdash; 1Password, F.lux, Skitch, and Evernote.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no consensus on whether menubar icons should be monochromatic (all black) or use a gradient.</p>

			 <h2 id="the-art-and-science-of-creating-chance">The art and science of creating chance</h2>
<p><em>This post was originally published on Medium in 2015.</em></p>
<p>In 2014 I was lucky enough to speak at <a href="http://memorialchurch.harvard.edu/morning-prayers-0">Morning Prayers</a>, a secular Harvard tradition that has existed since its founding in 1636. Below is a copy of my remarks.</p>
<hr>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<hr>
<p>Good morning. My name is Zachary Hamed, and I am a senior in Leverett House studying computer science. I’d like to begin with a reading from Ecclesiastes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chance—and its sister, serendipity—are the under-appreciated forces that drive the twists and turns in life. Serendipity is defined as the “the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way.” It was first penned by Horace Walpole in a letter to Horace Mann in 1754, who said he was inspired by an old Persian fairy tale called “The Three Princes of Serendip.”</p>
<p>As the story goes, the King of Serendip had three sons, whom he had educated with the best tutors in the land. After several years, the king felt his sons had mastered all the knowledge of the arts and sciences, but feared they had been too sheltered and privileged in their education. He sent his sons to the desert, where they wandered for days.</p>
<p>Late in their trip, they met a farmer who asked if they had seen his missing camel. The princes asked the farmer if his camel was blind in one eye, had a gap in its teeth, and was injured in one leg. When the farmer heard this, he accused the princes of stealing his camel and took them to the king.</p>
<p>When the king asked how his sons knew such intimate details of a stranger’s camel, they explained that their days of wandering had led them to notice small details in the environment. An animal had eaten the tougher and browner grass on the left side of the road, leading them to believe the animal was blind in one eye. There were lumps of chewed grass along the road that were the size of a camel’s tooth. And there were only 3 camel footprints on the road with the fourth being dragged, leading them to believe the camel was disabled in one leg. As soon as they finished, a traveller entered and reported he had found a lost camel in the desert. The princes were rewarded handsomely and their intuition trusted for years to come.</p>
<p>The story hits close to home because Cambridge resembles Serendip all too often. It is easy for us to be so ensconced in our research, our work, our meetings and our routine that we don’t make time for productive and creative wandering.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, a pair of medical researchers—one at NYU and one at Cornell—accidentally injected rabbits with a certain enzyme and noticed that the rabbits’ ears folded over. Neither had the time or funding to pursue the anomaly, so they buried it away in their lab notebooks. Several years later, only one of the professors decided to review his research notes when he realized the flopping ears were actually more important than his initial research was. <a href="http://www.nap.edu/readingroom.php?book=biomems&amp;page=lthomas.html">His work</a> led to a Nobel Prize, and a <a href="http://www.psyking.net/HTMLobj-3475/The_Case_of_the_Floppy-Eared_Rabbits.pdf">subsequent sociology paper</a> on the topic coined the terms serendipity gained (for example, reviewing your notes and deciding to pursue a question further) and serendipity lost—making the same discovery but never following up.</p>
<p>In short, serendipity enters our lives several times a day. We can gain it or lose it. But the best part is—we can engineer it. MIT Professor Ethan Zuckerman covers this phenomenon of creating luck. “Engineering serendipity,” he says, “is this idea that we can help people come across unexpected but helpful connections at a better than random rate. And in some ways it’s based on trying to reassess this notion of serendipitous as lucky — to think of serendipitous as smart.”</p>
<p>Harvard engineers serendipity at every point it can. You’re placed with a random group of your classmates when you enter as a freshman. Even when you’re allowed to choose your roommates in sophomore year, you’re placed randomly into houses and a lottery randomly places you into rooms. The lectures in your general education class could help you on a completely unrelated assignment in a different class. And have you noticed how many walking paths there are outside this very church? Walking through Harvard Yard is a case study in serendipity—it’s almost impossible to avoid seeing someone you know.</p>
<p>We meet best friends at events in Ticknor Lounge, significant others in early morning sections in Sever, mentors over lunch in Leverett dining hall, and overhear job opportunities in Lamont Cafe. Every minute on Harvard’s campus is a chance encounter waiting to happen.</p>
<p>Harvard’s secret is it takes a diverse group of people and squeezes them into a small, confined space. But the real world is a big place. And the scariest part is that serendipity will no longer be engineered for us. In fact, New York City, where I’ve been living for the past 4 months, seems to be engineered against serendipity. Have you ever tried meeting someone new on a New York City subway train? In a city of 8 million people, how do you find your new best friend? Your new job opportunity?</p>
<p>As always, Ralph Waldo Emerson provides the answer. “Shallow men,” he says, “believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect.” It is up to us to engineer serendipity once we leave Harvard’s gates. So talk to the person behind you in line at the coffee shop. Knock on your neighbor’s door in the otherwise anonymous apartment building you live in. Ask your friends to introduce you to someone new and go to lunch with them.</p>
<p>Be open to the unexpected today. Relish the uncertain. And embrace serendipity.</p>

<p><em>This post was originally published on Medium in 2015.</em></p>
<p>The value of design in a consumer app is fairly well appreciated today&mdash; design, branding, and user experience have a meaningful impact on customer happiness and retention.</p>
<p>For enterprise companies, however, it would be easy to underestimate the power of design. Many of these tools operate behind the scenes or on a server farm, so visual design isn&rsquo;t a priority.</p>
<p>Yet some of the best enterprise companies took design to heart. Their websites are an extension of their brand, and they use design to personify an otherwise faceless product. Stalwarts like Oracle and SAP might not have the most attractive sites, but new players leverage design to connect with their customers and differentiate themselves from their older and slower competitors:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xNNSmOO4fIIWnCSC_Cz2lg.gif" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<p>Some takeaways for enterprise companies:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Plan an annual redesign.</strong> Most of the sites above completely overhauled their websites at least once a year. While some of the changes are visual, the general UX of the page also improves. A lot changes in the design world in a year&rsquo;s time, and a lot also changes in enterprise. Redesign your site to reflect that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Photos of people help humanize your brand.</strong> Some of the above use stock photos (e.g. VMware), others use custom photos (e.g. Rackspace), and others use illustrated people (e.g. Joyent). In every case though, it seems like the company is trying to put a human touch on an otherwise amorphous product offering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Today, whitespace, color, and photos are preferred over dense text.</strong> This is partly a broader web design trend, but even enterprise companies that have complex offerings are putting documentation and features on separate pages, leaving the homepage free for calls-to-action, customer testimonials, and eye-catching photos. Consider Salesforce&rsquo;s site in 2010, VMware&rsquo;s site in 2010, or Heroku&rsquo;s site in 2012 versus their sites today.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.zmh.org/2013/12/03/the-best-lessons.html">The 20 Best Lessons from Social Psychology</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.zmh.org/2013/12/03/the-best-lessons.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2013-12-03 21:46:21 -0500">Dec 3, 2013</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last spring, I took a class on social psychology. It was one of the most useful classes I’ve ever taken, so I figured I’d share some of the more interesting findings. Each paragraph has a citation to its right so you can get more information or read the original study.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>1. Reciprocity has a strong effect on us.</strong></p>
<p>20% of people send Christmas cards back to people they’ve never met, just because they received one from them. For the same reason, tips to waiters go up 3.3% when an after-dinner mint is provided with the receipt. And when the server looked the diner in the eye and gave them a second mint? Tips went up 20%.</p>
<p><strong>2. You attribute a higher value to things you already own—this is known as the endowment effect.</strong></p>
<p>Willingness to sell was twice as high as willingness to pay in one study. In other words, participants were willing to buy a mug for $5, but once they owned it, they wouldn’t sell for less than $10.</p>
<p><strong>3. Heat makes us angry, and sadness physically makes us colder.</strong></p>
<p>When you feel rejected, you report the room as being colder and you prefer warmer foods over colder foods. Crime rates are higher in hotter regions, and crime is more likely on warmer days. Baseball pitchers are more likely to hit batters when it’s hot. This occurs because heat causes arousal, but people misattribute that arousal to situations around them and not to the heat.</p>
<p>Duchenne smiles (example B) that are exhibited in high school yearbook photos are correlated with better life outcomes 30 years later. Here, Paul Ekman—an expert in facial psychology—exhibits both non-Duchenne (exhibit A) and Duchenne smiles.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>4. Smiling is contagious—and can predict your happiness, professional success, and lifespan.</strong></p>
<p>Humans laugh more at movies when other people laugh. Additionally, many people smile at getting a strike in bowling only after they turn around to their friends—you smile for the social approval, not for doing something successfully. In another study, students who exhibited “Duchenne smiles”—a more authentic type of smile that engages the eye and mouth muscles—in their high school yearbook were more likely to get married and were more likely to self-describe as “happy” 30 years later. Students with less intense smiles were more likely to be divorced. And in any given year, people who exhibited Duchenne smiles in their high school yearbook were half as likely to die.</p>
<p><strong>5. How we’re approached and our desire to be consistent affect our decisions.</strong></p>
<p>If I asked you to volunteer for an “Experiment at 7AM,” would you do it? What about a “7AM experiment”? 56% of people asked to volunteer for the first did so, but only 24% volunteered for a “7AM experiment”—fewer people want to wake up early, so the ordering of the words matters. In another experiment, some participants were called and asked if they would hypothetically volunteer for the American Cancer Society. When they were contacted a few days later and asked to volunteer, 31% agreed—versus 4% of people who were cold-called and asked to volunteer for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>6. We act differently when reminded of who we are.</strong></p>
<p>When participants were told that men and women scored differently on a particular test, female participants’ performance dropped dramatically. Male participants’ performance on a task dropped after interacting with an attractive female participant. When children are in a group on Halloween, they take more candy on average—but when children were singled out and asked their names, they took far less candy.</p>
<p><strong>7. Being watched sometimes helps—except when eating.</strong></p>
<p>Having an audience of people watching you complete a task improves performance on simple tasks but hinders performance on more complex tasks or when learning a new skill (they showed this with both humans and cockroaches—don’t ask). The mere presence of someone in the room causes this effect; even a repairman working on something in the corner slowed people down. Yet when it comes to eating, a full chicken will overeat in the presence of another chicken, and animals eat more in pairs than when alone.</p>
<p><strong>8. Comparing people to their friends is the most effective way to make them do something.</strong></p>
<p>When an electric company tried to encourage people to save energy at home, telling them “your neighbors are reducing their energy use” led to a 2% reduction in household usage. Telling people “save energy to save money” or “save energy to save the environment” did not decrease, and in some cases increased, energy usage.</p>
<p><strong>9. Context—where we do something—has a substantive effect on what we do.</strong></p>
<p>56% of actual voters voted for a pro-school budget when voting in a school vs. 53% otherwise. While that effect may not seem huge, it’s statistically significant and was reproduced in a lab environment (64% of people voted for a fake pro-school budget when shown pictures of a school vs. 56% who voted for it otherwise).</p>
<p><strong>10. The more you’re exposed to something, the more you like it—this is called the mere exposure effect, and it works in milliseconds.</strong></p>
<p>Participants shown a foreign word frequently were more likely to say the word had a positive connotation. The most immediate application of this effect is advertising; the more often you’re exposed to a commercial or ad, the more positively you will rate the company. Flashing images that elicit positive or negative emotions for only a few milliseconds subliminally conditions your attitude.</p>
<p>People liked familiar objects more than abstract patterns, but in both cases participants overwhelmingly preferred curved objects over objects with sharp edges. Objects in category C (featuring both curves and edges) fell in between.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>11. Curves &gt; Edges.</strong></p>
<p>Humans overwhelmingly prefer curved visual objects over objects with jagged lines.</p>
<p><strong>12. Don’t get hurt when there are a lot of people around you.</strong></p>
<p>Bystanders are less likely to intervene in a crime or help in an emergency as the number of observers increases, as each individual feels that someone else will help and responsibility is diffused. When a victim is bloody, people help less often—likely because there is a chance they would be exposed to pathogens. But victims who scream receive more help than those who don’t—clear and unambiguous danger is helped far more often than not.</p>
<p><strong>13. We really want to be happy, but being too happy can negatively affect our work.</strong></p>
<p>In a study of 10,000 participants from 48 different countries, happiness is rated as more important than any other personal outcome—more than finding meaning in life, becoming rich, or getting into heaven. Happy people more often label themselves as “curious,” and depressed people are more likely to notice small changes in facial expressions. Yet extremely happy people (9/10 or 10/10 on a happy scale) got worse grades and had lower salaries than moderately happy people (6/10, 7/10, or 8/10 on a happy scale).</p>
<p><strong>14. We do stupid things because we want to conform.</strong></p>
<p>In one study, a participant was placed in a group and asked to answer a seemingly simple question. The rest of the people in the group were all told to respond with the same incorrect answer to the question, after which the participant was asked to answer in front of the group. 37 of 50 participants gave the same incorrect answer as the rest of the group (even though it was very clearly wrong), either because they wanted to be “liked” by the group or because they thought the rest of the group was more informed than they. This effect was dampened by having just one other person in the group agree with the participant.</p>
<p><strong>15. We have trouble separating out traits in a person.</strong></p>
<p>Globally positive or negative reactions on a person (“he’s a nice guy”) affect our judgment of a person’s specific traits (“he’s attractive”). This is called the halo effect, and is particularly noticeable in celebrities; their attractiveness or fame also leads us to believe they’re intelligent, happy, or honest.</p>
<p><strong>16. We’re influenced by very particular types of rewards.</strong></p>
<p>Expected rewards reduce motivation on a task. Surprise rewards increase motivation on the same task. Fixed rewards are less powerful than performance-based rewards, even with creative tasks.</p>
<p><strong>17. Authority can fundamentally change our emotions and behavior.</strong></p>
<p>In the Stanford Prison experiment, participants were split into prisoners and guards and placed into a mock prison. In just six days (of a planned two weeks), the experiment had to be shut down because guards were harassing and abusing prisoners, and prisoners began showing signs of emotional breakdown.</p>
<p>65% of participants knowingly delivered a lethal dose of electricity to a participant (who they later learned was fake) simply because the instructor in the room told them to.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>18. Authority can also make us be obedient and do things to other people we could never imagine.</strong></p>
<p>In the famous Milgram experiment, participants were told to administer a shock of increasing strength when a participant in another room gave incorrect answers to a series of questions. About halfway through, the shocks were labeled “danger: severe shock” and a recording was played begging the experimenter to stop the experiment. Yet in 63% of cases, the participant administered the maximum shock, even when the person they thought they were administering a lethal dose of electric shock to another human being.</p>
<p>A recreation of the original Stanford Marshmallow experiment is predictably adorable. Longitudinal studies have shown that students who can resist eating the marshmallow are better behaved and get better grades later in life.</p>
<p><strong>19. Self-control at an early age might be indicative of success later in life.</strong></p>
<p>In the famous Stanford marshmallow experiment, a group of children participants were asked to wait in a room with a table full of marshmallows and cookies. If they wanted, they could have one treat now and the experiment would be over. Otherwise, if they could wait for the experimenter to return in a few minutes, they could have two treats. The children who couldn’t delay their urges—either they asked for the treat right away, or tried to sneakily eat a treat when the experimenter left—had more behavior problems, lower SAT scores, more trouble paying attention in school, and found it difficult to maintain friendships. In fact, a child who could wait 15 minutes scored 210 points higher on the SAT than children who could wait only 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>20. People aspire to round number goals.</strong></p>
<p>I tried to make this list 20 bullet points long instead of 19, and you do the same thing when trying to run 2.0 miles instead of 1.9. In Major League Baseball, players were four times as likely to end the season with a 0.300 batting average than 0.299. And when looking at over 4 million SAT scores, students who scored a 1290 were more likely to retake the test than students who scored a 1300—even though admissions offices did not statistically favor one score over the other.</p>

			 <h3 id="rhetoric-and-speech-in-the-clinton-administration">Rhetoric and Speech in the Clinton Administration.</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/t/NaN/NaN/0*AFUc0SJPKM2PWqEb.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>This post was originally published on Medium in 2013.</em></p>
<p>Below is an abbreviated version of an essay I wrote on Bill Clinton, his administration, and how rhetoric saved his presidency. Before the essay though, I wanted to include some choice quotes I found in my research that didn&rsquo;t make it into the paper (bolding is my addition).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Any president would rather receive and reply as Clinton did at a town hall meeting:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Hello, Mr. President&mdash;President Clinton. My question is, my birthday is tomorrow and I&rsquo;m twelve years old tomorrow, and my question is, what kind of future am I going to have in store for me and the country?</p>
<p><strong>The President:</strong> That&rsquo;s a neat question, isn&rsquo;t it? (Laughter) I think you&rsquo;ve got a very bright future. The world you will live in will be freer of the threat of total destruction than any world we&rsquo;ve ever known.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The hottest moment of the town meeting came when the president abandoned his usual empathic style and directly confronted a questioner.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> Mr. President, in 1993 when interest rates were declining, your administration took credit for that. But now both long- and short-term rates are higher than when you took office. Will your administration now take responsibility for higher rates?</p>
<p><strong>The President:</strong> Why do you think they went up?</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> Well, I&rsquo;m asking you.</p>
<p><strong>The President:</strong> I&rsquo;m asking you. You asked me to take responsibility, so I ask you why. They plainly went down after we declared our deficit reduction package. That&rsquo;s why they went down. They have gone up, I think, for two reasons, maybe three.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Oral history interviews confirm that Clinton often did work on speeches up to the very moment of their delivery&mdash;and indeed would often extemporize while speaking. The story of the teleprompter and the healthcare speech is recounted in George Stephanopoulos, &ldquo;All Too Human: A Political Education&rdquo;. The wrong speech was initially loaded into the teleprompter], an accident brought on by the fact that the text was being worked on so late that no time was left to check the process. <strong>For several minutes, Clinton was forced to speak before a national television audience while an alphabet soup of verbiage spooled past his eyes on the teleprompter screens.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Peggy Noonan takes us closer to the answer to the Clinton paradox:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never tongue-tied and never eloquent&mdash;six years into his presidency, his only candidates for Bartlett&rsquo;s are &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t inhale&rsquo; and &lsquo;The era of big government is over&rsquo;&mdash;his easy facility is a two-edged sword. While it suggests a certain command, it also highlights Clinton&rsquo;s prime perceptual problem: that he is too fluid, too smooth, like <strong>a real estate salesman talking to a walk-in with a Rolex</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, onto the essay.</p>
<hr>
<p>President Bill Clinton is a case study in the power of the rhetorical presidency.</p>
<p>Richard Neustadt, in his <em>Presidential Power and the Modern Presidents,</em> describes presidents as formidable leaders who use their power to persuade. Yet Bill Clinton was not a towering, unopposed president. He served at a crossroads&mdash;the Cold War had just ended; the Internet, cable news, and consequent shorter news cycles were just becoming mainstream; and during his tenure Congressional opposition threatened the presidency in unprecedented ways.</p>
<p>Compounding these larger trends, Clinton suffered what most pundits believed would be a debilitating scandal, yet left the office with one of the highest approval ratings of any president in modern times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;How can a man lie multiple times, cheat on his wife, commit perjury, and become one of the most popular presidents of recent history?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clinton surmounted these challenges through his extraordinary use of presidential rhetorical power. To his supporters, Clinton seemed to have the magical ability to relate to anyone; to his opponents, Clinton&rsquo;s magic was the seduction of the American people. The Clinton presidency demonstrates the importance of the Presidential bully pulpit&mdash;while his rhetoric shifted from at first attempting to directly reach citizens to eventually acknowledging the press' role in spreading his message, Clinton&rsquo;s legacy survived because he converted his rhetorical talent into political capital.</p>
<p>Clinton&rsquo;s rhetoric was unusually powerful because of its conversational style. As Clinton&rsquo;s head speechwriter Michael Waldman remembers, &ldquo;his strength was never soaring rhetoric&rdquo;&mdash;thirty minute speeches were reduced into half the time, and new speechwriters were warned he took &ldquo;Hemingway [and turned it] into Faulkner. Rather, Clinton&rsquo;s powerful gift at communicating grew from the intensity of his connection to the audience before him&hellip;.He might dutifully read along with the prepared draft. Then, when he sensed the listeners were with him, or were resisting, he would leave the text, start dropping his consonants, and loop around and around the subject, trying to persuade the audience until he had won the point.&rdquo; After winning the presidency largely based on his rhetorical gifts in town halls and conversations with voters, Clinton was poised to benefit from and depend on rhetoric once in office.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LKesvqj_LwyLEq1l.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>President Clinton&rsquo;s first 100 days in office aimed to leverage this strength. Under Clinton, &ldquo;speechwriters were once again privy to policymaking and political strategy,&rdquo; reversing a pattern by previous presidents of pushing speechwriters out of the decision-making process. Speechwriters reported directly to the Chief of Staff and the President himself. Clinton gave 550 speeches in a typical year&mdash;nearly double the 320 President Reagan gave per year. In the two years between his inauguration and the first midterm elections, Clinton traveled to almost two hundred town halls across the country.</p>
<p>These events were meant to sell the President&rsquo;s healthcare bill, his vision for the country, and the Democratic Party. Clinton thrived in the town hall environment&mdash;the &ldquo;relaxed questions he received&rdquo; there allowed his enthusiasm for &ldquo;spontaneous give-and take&rdquo; to shine through. Clinton&rsquo;s rhetorical strategy was to &ldquo;bypass traditional journalist mediation between leaders and citizens&rdquo; because he believed &ldquo;journalists were gaining more influence over political and campaign agendas.&rdquo; Given Clinton&rsquo;s rhetorical talent, his administration&rsquo;s strategy hoped to forge connections with voters and circumvent conventional media.</p>
<p>Even after news organizations helped spread Clinton&rsquo;s campaign message, the new administration failed to appreciate how conventional media helps presidents communicate once elected. President Clinton, like Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon, Carter, and Reagan before him, held the press at arm&rsquo;s length and mainly spoke to press at more formal, controlled events. In a stunning rebuke of conventional media, Clinton held a question and answer session with schoolchildren visiting the White House before he ever appeared before the White House press corps. Within three weeks of taking office, Clinton had spoken with live studio audiences in four separate cities via satellite, but had still not held a formal press conference.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When asked by the Radio and Television Correspondents Association why he shied away from press conferences, Clinton answered, &ldquo;Because Larry King has liberated me from you by giving me to the American people directly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The President opted for more intimate events, like one-on-one interviews with Larry King or town hall meetings, that allowed his unique talent for casual rhetoric to dominate.</p>
<p>This strategy unexpectedly backfired for the Clinton administration. His signature healthcare bill failed in Congress, his poll numbers dropped, and Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections. Clinton&rsquo;s favored town hall format was quickly abandoned as &ldquo;the format increasingly became a forum for negative and confrontational interactions between citizens and the president, providing fodder for negative national news.&rdquo; Yet despite these defeats, &ldquo;Clinton never gave up on the idea that all he needed was a few more speeches, or a slightly better message. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to&hellip;spend more time communicating with the American people,&rsquo; the President said in a 1994 interview&hellip;.It seems never to have occurred to him or his staff that his basic strategy may have been inherently flawed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clinton initially blamed his waning support on the negative press he had been receiving, not on his rhetorical strategy. When asked by <em>Rolling Stone</em> how he would respond to a disappointed supporter, Clinton responded angrily, &ldquo;that man has a false impression of me because of the way this administration has been covered. It is wrong. I have fought my guts out for that guy, and if he doesn&rsquo;t know it, it&rsquo;s not my fault.&rdquo; In June of 1993, Clinton realized &ldquo;the level of acrimony&rdquo; between his administration and the press was self-defeating&mdash;&ldquo;clearly harm was being done.&rdquo; With the public losing faith in his leadership, he brought in David Gergen&mdash;who had helped Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Reagan with their communications strategies&mdash;to forge a new path.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*sp0KQbqxzvaW69I-.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>If Clinton&rsquo;s first 100 days are the story of his rhetorical strategy failing to understand political and media realities, the Monica Lewinsky scandal is the story of the media failing to understand the power of Clinton&rsquo;s rhetoric. Just days before the State of the Union, news of the affair broke in the press. According to Clinton&rsquo;s head speechwriter at the time, the President and his administration decided he would not address the scandal at all in his speech; they wanted Clinton to use his rhetoric to put the administration back on message. And indeed, &ldquo;Clinton went on to save his presidency with a rousing State of the Union address in which he secured public favor by sternly demanding that Congress &lsquo;save Social Security&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The resulting post-speech approval boost&mdash;by some measures, as much as 16%&mdash;carried him through the scandal to the end of his administration. In fact, Clinton&rsquo;s approval rating never fell below 60% during the scandal and hit a high of 73% twice&mdash;once on the day the House voted to impeach Clinton, and again when the Senate voted to acquit. Despite the fact that nearly half of all stories about the Clinton administration in the three months after the scandal broke focused on the affair, the scandal provided a reason for additional coverage of the administration, which often included other positive coverage of Clinton&rsquo;s policies and agenda. By staying on message, the Clinton White House leveraged the negative press to more frequently present their issues.</p>
<p>With the scandal&rsquo;s spotlight on him, Clinton used the media frenzy to showcase his rhetorical power, this time in conjunction with the press instead of in opposition to it. The day before the State of the Union, Hillary Clinton and Vice President Al Gore hosted a press conference on afterschool education programs. At the last minute, speechwriters were told the President would deliver remarks on education at the gathering, with the unstated goal of making a statement about the Lewinsky scandal as well. They hurriedly &ldquo;spliced the entire education section straight out of the State of the Union address and turned it into a statement.&rdquo; Those remarks&mdash;containing the President&rsquo;s education vision for the next year&mdash;were presented to a live audience &ldquo;larger than for the State of the Union itself.&rdquo; The President used the scandal as a soapbox to elevate issues that affected the American people, and they in turn rewarded him with unwavering approval ratings above 60%.</p>
<p>Despite initially miscalculating how to deliver his rhetoric to the American people, Clinton&rsquo;s rhetoric successfully elevated the office of the president and inspired the American public. He successfully used his rhetorical talent to craft a rhetorical presidency that furthered his administrative and legislative goals, a success reflected in unwaveringly high approval ratings throughout the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Once he applied rhetoric through existing media channels, rhetoric proved to be one of his most powerful assets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It was a new kind of presidency, less dependent on legislation, more rooted in a president&rsquo;s unique power to act and to speak. With his stream of speeches and announcements, he was trying, bit by bit, to restore public confidence in government, to show that it could get things done&hellip; This will most likely be his lasting legacy: redefining the role of government and then successfully convincing the public to share that vision.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To President Clinton, the rhetorical presidency <em>was</em> the presidency.</p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>In a speech to the Democratic Nation Committee in 1999, he waxed poetic:</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And let me just close with this story. I want to tell you a story that I thought about that I told the folks at home when I went to dedicate my birthplace. Last year I had a 91-year-old great uncle who died. He was my grandmother&rsquo;s brother. And I loved him very much, and he helped to raise me when my mother was widowed and went off to study so she could be a nurse anesthetist, and my grandparents were raising me.</em></p>
<p><em>And this old man and I were close from the time I was born. He and his wife were married for over 50 years, and she came down with Alzheimer&rsquo;s. And they had one of these old-fashioned houses with gas stoves, so they had to take her to the local nursing facility that was tied to our nursing home in this little town because they were afraid she&rsquo;d turn on the stove and forget about it and blow the house up. We can laugh&mdash;we all laughed about it. It&rsquo;s okay to laugh. I&rsquo;ve lost two relatives to Alzheimer&rsquo;s. You have to laugh to keep from crying half the time&hellip;&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Two paragraphs, 224 words, and a lot of laughter later, Clinton was still at his story, with no end in sight. I cite the rest of the speech not for its significance but for its pointlessness:</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;So I went to see him one night, about 10 years ago, after his wife went into this nursing home. And they&rsquo;d been married over 50 years. And the first 20 or 30 minutes we talked, all he did was tell me jokes and tell me stories and think about the old days. And I was walking out and for the only time in our life, he grabbed me by the arm. And I looked around and he had big old tears in his eyes. And I said, &lsquo;This is really hard on you, isn&rsquo;t it.&rsquo; And he said this, he said, &lsquo;Yes, it is. But,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you know, I signed on for the whole load, and most of it was pretty good.'</em></p>
<p><em>When you were up there singing &lsquo;Stand By Me&rsquo; tonight and I thought about how the American people have stood by me through thick and thin, I would just like to say to all of you, when I talk about community, that&rsquo;s what I mean. [Applause] Now, wait a minute. You don&rsquo;t have to sit down, because I&rsquo;m nearly through. [Laughter]</em> <em><strong>Don&rsquo;t sit down. Don&rsquo;t sit down. I&rsquo;m nearly through.</strong></em> <em>Here&rsquo;s the point I want to make: The reason I wanted you to come here tonight, the reason I&rsquo;m thankful for your contributions, the reason I&rsquo;m thankful for what you do is, this country has got to get over believing that our political life is about beating each other up and hurting people, instead of lifting people up and bringing them together. That is what I&rsquo;ve tried to do. That is what we stand for. And if we remember that, we&rsquo;re going to do just fine in the 21st century.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you, and God bless you.&quot;</em></p>

			 <h3 id="why-you-should-spend-your-3-college-summers-in-new-york-san-francisco-and-boston">Why you should spend your 3 college summers in New York, San Francisco, and Boston.</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/t/NaN/NaN/0*-q8wyKHSzE5JJJZG.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>This post was originally published on Medium in 2013.</em></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something to be said about trying different industries or roles each summer while you&rsquo;re in college. There&rsquo;s also something to be said for <em>living</em> somewhere different each time.</p>
<p>The college summer is a sacred time. Yes, it&rsquo;s prime time for relaxation before another stressful school year, but it&rsquo;s also one of the biggest opportunities you have to explore new fields and develop yourself professionally.</p>
<p>Boston in the summer is a special place. With thousands of college students gone, an otherwise bustling city is made calm. A town full of academics and business leaders suddenly has more time for coffee meetings and advice.</p>
<p>Time spent in San Francisco is the best way to learn the ins and outs of technology, despite being unreasonably cold for the entire summer. Nowhere else can you walk down the street and see the offices and founders of companies you admire.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a special place in my heart for New York City summers. The cool nights, the sound of ice cream trucks, and the blisteringly hot subway tunnels give the city its character. You won&rsquo;t find the same density of students in the same diversity of fields and industries as you will in New York.</p>
<p>After spending my freshman summer in Boston, my sophomore summer in New York, and my junior summer in San Francisco, I have a new appreciation for each city.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stick in the same city for your summers in college&mdash;travel and try living in a new city. Half of exploring during the summer is finding what you want to do after college. The other half is finding out where you want to do it.</p>

<p><em>This post was originally published on Medium in 2013.</em></p>
<p>In high school I organized a large conference for 1000+ attendees. I managed a $20,000 budget and a team of ~15 other students, planning 6 months in advance for a 2 day event.</p>
<p>Event planning might be the closest you can get to starting a company. You have people counting on you, you have a set of constraints, and despite months or years of planning, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">Murphy&rsquo;s Law</a> always seems to take hold.</p>
<p>Remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull">Eyjafjallajökull</a>? It decided to rain ash across all of Europe as a box of 1000 gift bags for our attendees was on a freighter en route to New York. Lunch was an hour late. Ice cream melted in the unseasonably warm weather. Our registration system went down when the internet connection in the venue slowed to a crawl. People were lost in the building because of poor signage.</p>
<p>So much for planning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how smart or experienced you are, how long you have to plan, or how many people you have helping you. When something goes wrong&mdash;when <em>everything</em> goes wrong&mdash;your success depends on how well you can adapt and fix things. You need to be more MacGyver than Nate Silver, more Jack Bauer than Sherlock.</p>
<p>Problem-solving is a muscle, and just like muscles in your body there are slow-twitch and fast-twitch decisions. Engineers are great at analyzing problems over long periods of time. Trying to decide what car to buy or what framework will be most efficient? We can systematically analyze the data we have to come to a best guess. But how well do you behave under pressure? Can you find a bug in under a minute when it&rsquo;s preventing millions of users from logging in? How do you respond when you have 1000 people waiting for lunch and the delivery truck is stuck in traffic?</p>
<p>Things always go wrong. How quickly you make those snap decisions is all that matters.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ewQlu-cpHovCTR4o.png" alt="me in 1997 or so, making iphone apps before it was cool."></p>
<p>Today I have the honor to announce a major step in my life&mdash;after several months of applications and a few weeks of heavy consideration, I&rsquo;ll be taking at least 2 years off from Harvard in December to be a member of the <a href="http://www.thielfellowship.org/">Thiel 20 Under 20 Fellowship</a>. The first of many thanks go to the Thiel Foundation for giving me this opportunity and giving me their stamp of approval&mdash;it&rsquo;s been an amazing interview process and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier to be a part of the Thiel Fellowship community.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t an easy decision to make, but I think my situation is unique. I&rsquo;ve wanted to work full-time on education for a while, and I&rsquo;ve been enveloped in entrepreneurship for the past few years. My mom is a teacher and my dad is a self-employed programmer. I&rsquo;ve been breathing education since I could walk and designed my first website in 4th grade. It&rsquo;s about time I put those skills to good use.</p>
<p>After reflecting on where I&rsquo;ve been and where I hope to be, it&rsquo;s clear that 99% of where I am can be attributed to other people. Amazing people who took bets on me when they shouldn&rsquo;t have, people who cared enough to reach out to me, people who I could call at any time for help. Tony Tjan, in his book <em>Heart, Smarts, Guts, and Luck</em>, helps entrepreneurs determine what their core skill set is, and by his assessment I&rsquo;m overwhelmingly luck-dominant. Let me take this time, then, to thank everyone who has helped me to this point, and in doing so describe how I got here.</p>
<hr>
<p>My mom came to this country in high school from Cyprus after having spent time in London. Her father was a farmer and construction worker and her mother worked with textiles sewing clothing. My dad studied computer science and accounting in Egypt, then spent several years as a farmhand and sous chef in Spain and France before coming to the United States. Here, he continued studying engineering and computer science, working full-time and going to school on nights and weekends. My parents met at the City University of New York and got married a few years later. They&rsquo;re the hardest working people I know, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be here today without the many sacrifices they made for my education.</p>
<p>By 1985 or so, my mom was a first-grade teacher in a New York City public school. (She still teaches in that same first-grade classroom, and has been teaching for 28 years.) Since both my parents worked full-time, I spent the first few years of my life in a crib in the back of her classroom. (I was a well-behaved baby.) I then enrolled in that same East Harlem, New York public school as a student. Through years of their hard work, long nights, and 4-hour commutes to and from Long Island into New York City, I was contacted as a fifth grader by an organization called <a href="http://prepforprep.org/">Prep for Prep</a> that helps minority students get accepted into private schools. After going through several steps of interviews and being accepted, I spent 14 months going to night classes studying U.S. History, Biology, Latin,and more. I wouldn&rsquo;t be where I am today without Prep&mdash;thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/charlesg">Charles Guerrero</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/katybordonaro">Katy Bordonaro</a>, and the rest of the team there for all the work they do.</p>
<p>After what I still consider to be the hardest academic experience of my life, I was accepted to <a href="http://collegiateschool.org/">Collegiate School</a>, a small all-boys school on the Upper West Side. I realized there that I loved my extracurriculars above all else. I organized an environmental conference for 1000+ attendees and a $15,000+ budget. Event planning is the closest job to being a CEO I know. Everything that can go wrong will go wrong, and you absolutely need to think on your feet. Collegiate gave me the freedom to explore what I was interested in&mdash;thank you to Mrs. Foley, Dr. Beall, Mr. Hill, Mr. Gordon, and the million other teachers there who were my biggest academic and professional critics. Collegiate was my launchpad to Harvard and I can&rsquo;t wait to give back to it in every way I can.</p>
<hr>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t come to Harvard as an entrepreneur, but I knew I wanted to study computer science. This was the first computer I ever used:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2aMX9HFqx1tw0FHH.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>My dad wrote a game that helped me learn the alphabet on that machine, and computers were always around the house since he was a programmer. I wrote my first program in Visual Basic and wrote my first HTML code back in 4th grade for my own little company, Blue Box Software (the logo was suspiciously similar to today&rsquo;s Dropbox logo). I took two Harvard Summer School classes in computer science and was hooked since then.</p>
<p>Here at Harvard, I got involved with <a href="http://hackharvard.org/">Hack Harvard</a> and the <a href="http://i-lab.harvard.edu/">Innovation Lab</a> at just the right time. Interest in entrepreneurship was beginning to pick up, so I had the opportunity to learn from some of the best startup leaders around and help fellow students who were also interested in the tech world.</p>
<p>So, thank you to the Innovation Lab&mdash;Gordon, <a href="http://www.nealdoyle.com/">Neal</a>, Kate&mdash;for your support and mentorship over the past few years. Thanks to Harvard for accelerating my growth and helping to introduce me to some of the brightest minds in technology. Thank you to the rest of my mentors&mdash;<a href="http://www.hugovanvuuren.com/">Hugo Van Vuuren</a>, Nick and Tuan from <a href="http://tivli.com/">Tivli</a>, <a href="http://andrewjrosenthal.com/">Andrew Rosenthal</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/bznotes">Bilal</a> and Nitesh at <a href="http://generalcatalyst.com/">General Catalyst</a>, and so many others&mdash;who have been sounding boards for all my crazy ideas and questions. Thanks to my friends and roommates&mdash;Sebastian, Matt, Will, Mike&mdash;for dealing with my late nights and craziness. Thanks to one of my best friends, Andrea Brettler, who has offered her advice and support since freshman year. Special thanks go to <a href="http://pboyce.com/">Peter Boyce</a>, who has been my biggest supporter and harshest critic for the past 3 years, and <a href="http://perryhewitt.com/">Perry Hewitt</a>, who offers the most sage advice and the wittiest jokes of anyone I know.</p>
<p>My work at <a href="http://roughdraft.vc/">Rough Draft Ventures</a> over the past year has shown me how dedicated student entrepreneurs can be. After funding many of the best student ideas in Boston, it&rsquo;s clear that Boston and New York are now tech hubs of their own. I grew up in New York and grew academically, professionally, and intellectually in Boston. Those cities are my roots, and I hope to be the bridge between this East Coast hub that&rsquo;s rapidly growing and the storied Silicon Valley ecosystem that has so much to offer the students growing companies here in Boston. I will continue to work with Rough Draft and help students, and the fact that our partners are doing such diverse things is a testament to the types of students we&rsquo;re looking to fund&mdash;people are willing to drop everything they&rsquo;re doing and pursue an idea relentlessly.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited for what the next two years hold.</p>

<p>Then the Popular Electronics article came out. Gates' friend Paul Allen ran through Harvard Square with the article to wave it in front of Gates' face and say, &ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s going to happen! I told you this was going to happen!

He immediately phoned MITS, claiming that he and his partner had a BASIC language usable on the Altair. When Ed Roberts, who had heard a lot of such promises, asked Gates when he could come to Albuquerque to demonstrate it, Gates looked at his childhood friend, took a deep breath, and said, &ldquo;Oh, in two or three weeks.&rdquo; Gates put down the receiver, turned to Allen and said: &ldquo;I guess we should go buy a manual.&rdquo; They went straight to an electronics shop and purchased Adam Osborne&rsquo;s manual on the 8080.</p>

<p><em>This post was originally published on Medium in 2013.</em></p>
<p>As I finish this semester, I thought it might be valuable to shed some light into the unique entrepreneurship scene at Harvard. It can be clichéd, but it&rsquo;s hard to deny Bill Gates&rsquo;s and Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s Harvard roots. There&rsquo;s increased interest in entrepreneurship on all college campuses, but at Harvard it has accelerated especially rapidly given <em>The Social Network</em> and the Facebook IPO. The startup scene has grown beyond recognition in the three years I&rsquo;ve been on campus&mdash;I&rsquo;m a junior now&mdash;so I&rsquo;ll try to objectively describe the various initiatives around campus and then offer my own thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="harvard-innovation-lab">Harvard Innovation Lab</h3>
<p>The largest addition to Harvard&rsquo;s entrepreneurship efforts this year was the new <a href="http://i-lab.harvard.edu">Innovation Lab</a> (i-lab for short). The 30,000-square-foot ground floor features day-use space, reserved space for incubated teams, a classroom, conference rooms, a kitchen stocked with snacks, and a game room filled with video games.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*R1Kh9oa_XLiqUoPJ.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Physically, the building is on the Harvard Business School campus. While it isn&rsquo;t next to the center of campus (Harvard Yard), the vast majority of entrepreneurship events are now hosted there, so many students have been spending more time there. The i-lab has hosted a <a href="http://www.ocs.fas.harvard.edu/students/jobs/startupfair.htm">startup career fair</a>, a <a href="http://harvard.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> hackathon, and office hours with venture capitalists and entrepreneurs-in-residence.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bLymfBWDKnWmrQR7.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="university-sponsored-initiatives">University-Sponsored Initiatives</h3>
<p>Considering that the i-lab hosts or runs many of these initiatives, it makes sense to describe these next. The administration recently came out strongly in support of entrepreneurship, sponsoring a <a href="http://i-lab.harvard.edu/presidents-challenge">President&rsquo;s Challenge</a> that awarded 10 teams $5,000 each to advance their ventures in the areas of clear air, clean water, global health, personal health, and education. A panel of professors then awarded a grand-prize winner and up to three finalists a total of $100,000 to develop their ventures during the summer. While money isn&rsquo;t the only solution to encouraging entrepreneurship, the resources and backing of the University certainly go a long way to helping student-led ventures.</p>
<h3 id="the-experiment-fund">The Experiment Fund</h3>
<p>Probably the second most important announcement of the past term was the launch of the <a href="http://experimentfund.com/">Experiment Fund</a>, a seed fund run by NEA, Accel Partners, and Polaris Ventures to help fund student ventures. While the fund was initially launched at Harvard, it is expanding to include other colleges in Cambridge. The fund has already financed a few ventures, including health incubator <a href="http://rockhealth.com/">Rock Health</a> and TV-over-the-Internet startup <a href="http://tivli.com/">Tivli</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hack-harvard">Hack Harvard</h3>
<p>The newest technical addition to startup extracurriculars is <a href="http://hackharvard.org">Hack Harvard</a>, an organization that brings together mostly engineering students who are working on personal projects. An emphasis is placed on cool hacks or integration of third-party APIs. In the last year, they welcomed a number of technical speakers, among them <a href="http://azarask.in">Aza Raskin</a> of <a href="http://massivehealth.com">Massive Health</a> and former creative lead of Firefox. They also <a href="http://bostinno.com/2012/04/25/the-winklevoss-twins-returned-to-harvard-last-night-storify/">welcomed</a> the Winklevoss twins and Divya Narendra of <em>The Social Network</em> fame.</p>
<p>Hack Harvard runs an incubator program over winter break for campus startups. Students learn more about web development and design through a number of workshops led by professors and upperclassmen. They spend the rest of their time advancing their projects in anticipation of a demo day for other students, investors, and the Boston community.</p>
<h3 id="rough-draft-ventures">Rough Draft Ventures</h3>
<p>Just a few months ago, <a href="http://www.generalcatalyst.com">General Catalyst</a> helped launch a new seed-stage fund in Boston for students working on a startup of their own. <a href="http://roughdraft.vc">Rough Draft Ventures</a> gives students up to $25,000 in the form of an uncapped convertible note to fund their venture. Its <a href="http://blog.roughdraft.vc/post/44617668100/announcing-our-first-investment-20-000-in-balbus">first investment</a> was $20,000 in <a href="http://balbusspeech.com/">Balbus Speech</a>, a company focused on special education and speech therapy.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XyybeEJ3e8RMrjwZ.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="zuck-returns-to-campus">Zuck returns to campus</h3>
<p>The biggest tech celebrity to come to campus in 2012 was Mark Zuckerberg, who <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/11/zuckerberg-'friends'-harvard-during-visit/">returned</a> for the first time since dropping out in 2004. His homecoming was billed as a recruiting talk, and he spoke to an audience of computer science students. Overall, his visit further invigorated campus interest in computer science.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*WS1_JZlcg9ElWgRc.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="computer-science-department">Computer Science Department</h3>
<p>The most notable addition to the Harvard CS program was <a href="https://www.cs164.net/">Computer Science 164: Mobile Software Engineering</a>. The class is not only an introduction to iOS programming and jQuery Mobile, but also a great primer in industry-standard software development practices, including pair programming, code reviews, source control, unit testing, MVC frameworks, and database scaling. The class is taught by star CS professor David Malan, who also teaches the introductory CS class, <a href="http://cs50.net">CS 50</a>. CS 50, a 10-week overview of computer science in C, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, is now the second most enrolled class at the College following Introduction to Economics, demonstrating the surging popularity of CS at Harvard.</p>
<h3 id="social-entrepreneurship">Social Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>The entrepreneurship scene isn&rsquo;t limited to tech startups. Students are interested in social entrepreneurship across a number of areas, including education, health, clean tech, and more. Through extracurriculars like the Social Innovation Collaborative and University initiatives like the <a href="http://i-lab.harvard.edu/presidents-challenge/">President&rsquo;s Challenge</a>, there is an emphasis on socially-oriented ventures.</p>
<h3 id="business-plan-competition-winners">Business Plan Competition Winners</h3>
<p>There are two main business plan competitions on campus. College students enter the <a href="http://harvardi3.org/">i3 competition</a>, while HBS students enter the <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/entrepreneurship/bplan/">HBS Business Plan competition</a>. Past winners of the HBS competition include <a href="http://renttherunway.com">Rent The Runway</a>, <a href="http://birchbox.com/">Birchbox</a>, <a href="http://cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>, <a href="https://relayrides.com/">RelayRides</a>, and <a href="http://www.thredup.com/">thredUP</a>. In 2012, the winner of the business venture track was <a href="http://i-lab.harvard.edu/long-term-residents/vaxess-technologies">Vaxess Technologies</a>, a company working to commercialize a technology to condense vaccines into a thin film strip that can be shipped and stored without refrigeration. <a href="http://bostinno.com/2012/04/25/harvard-business-schools-business-plan-contest-doles-out-over-150k/">Here&rsquo;s</a> a full list of the winners and runners-up.</p>
<p>On the college level, a total of $50,000 was awarded to six major award winners for everything from a foot shape analysis technology to an iPad point-of-sale survey platform. <a href="http://bostinno.com/2012/03/30/the-6-winners-who-walked-away-with-their-share-of-50k-from-harvards-i3-challenge/">Here&rsquo;s</a> the full list of winners.</p>
<h3 id="harvard-college-venture-partners">Harvard College Venture Partners</h3>
<p>There is also a strong interest in venture capital on campus, the main activity for which is <a href="http://www.hcvp.co/">Harvard College Venture Partners</a>, or HCVP. HCVP brings venture capitalists and successful entrepreneurs to campus to speak with Harvard startup founders. One of its main objectives is to facilitate cross-campus collaboration, particularly with Harvard Business School students and professors.</p>
<h3 id="hbs">HBS</h3>
<p>Harvard Business School has become notably more open to sharing its resources with the rest of the University. The i-lab is one way of connecting HBS professors with undergrads and other schools. A new class taught to undergrads this year was U.S. and the World 36: Innovation and Entrepreneurship. The class&mdash;a survey on innovation across disciplines&mdash;was taught with HBS&rsquo;s signature case study method. It was primarily taught by professors <a href="http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=ovr&amp;facId=6498">Joe Lassiter</a> and <a href="http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=ovr&amp;facId=6585/">Mihir Desai</a> and co-taught by visiting professors from other Harvard schools, including the Kennedy School of Government and Engineering School. The course culminated with students working on over 40 real-world projects at various startups and organizations.</p>
<p>Harvard Business School students have also increasingly turned to the College to learn about CS. Enrollment in CS50 by HBS students was sharply up this past fall. <a href="http://www.hinnovates.org/2012/why-mbas-should-learn-computer-science-reflections-on-cs50/">Many students</a> were happy with their decision to take it, and the increased interaction with undergrads was largely welcome (though I don&rsquo;t believe many undergrads have bandwidth to work on outside projects, which I describe more below).</p>
<p>This shift towards openness was both student- and faculty-driven. The new FIELD curriculum requires that all ~900 first-year students conceive, establish, and grow a business using $5,000 in seed money from HBS. This broad shift in the first-year curriculum followed the success of <a href="http://startuptribe.com">Startup Tribe</a>, HBS&rsquo;s homegrown entrepreneurship club founded just two years ago. As I understand it, entrepreneurship among the HBS student body was previously an afterthought, something only a small percentage of students did. Startup Tribe helped change the entrepreneurship scene on campus, so much so that its founders <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/deansaward2012.html">recently received</a> the Dean&rsquo;s Award for their efforts.</p>
<h3 id="hls-and-the-harvard-law-entrepreneurship-project">HLS and the Harvard Law Entrepreneurship Project</h3>
<p>Further demonstrating how Harvard&rsquo;s graduate schools are now collaborating, the <a href="http://hlep.org/">Harvard Law Entrepreneurship Project</a> (HLEP) helps student startups avoid common legal pitfalls and critically assess the viability of their businesses. Each semester, after a pitching and vetting process, the <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/academics/clinical/spos/student-practice-organizations.html">Student Practice Organization</a> pairs law student teams and an attorney advisor from <a href="http://www.cooley.com/index.aspx">Cooley</a>, <a href="http://www.gunder.com/">Gunderson Dettmer</a>, or <a href="http://www.wilmerhale.com/">WilmerHale</a> with ten to twelve student entrepreneur teams. All projects are also reviewed by the current General Counsel of <a href="http://crv.com/">Charles River Ventures</a>. HLEP has worked with entrepreneurs from virtually every school at Harvard so far. Recently, HLEP&rsquo;s leadership organized <a href="http://i-lab.harvard.edu/2013/03/07/learning-hack-law">Hack IP</a>, a weekend-long event dedicated to brainstorming and developing a policy about copyright that <a href="https://www.edx.org/university_profile/HarvardX">HarvardX</a> should adopt.</p>
<h3 id="i-lab-silicon-valley-trek">i-lab Silicon Valley Trek</h3>
<p>Another effort to raise interest in entrepreneurship as a career choice was the Innovation Lab&rsquo;s trek to Silicon Valley. About 40 students, evenly split between HBS students and undergrads, Graduate School of Education, Kennedy School, and engineering graduate students, visited Silicon Valley VCs, startups, and incubators.</p>
<p>We heard from <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100216/the-start-up-whisperer-michael-dearing-is-the-hottest-angel-investor-youve-never-heard-of/">Michael Dearing</a> at Harrison Metal; serial entrepreneur <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2010-08-03-cassidy03_ST_N.htm/">Mike Cassidy</a>; <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/partner/randy-komisar">Randy Komisar</a> from Kleiner Perkins; <a href="http://postdesk.com/matthew-prince-cloudflare-interview/">Matthew Prince</a> at Cloudflare; <a href="http://www.thredup.com/about/team">James Reinhart</a> at thredUP; <a href="http://www.ideo.com/people/diego-rodriguez">Diego Rodriguez</a> at IDEO; and many more.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Cloudflare was founded on that same trip in 2009, when founders Matt Prince and Michelle Zatlyn developed the idea in the hotel bar in between trips to startups. Having that in mind as we visited Harvard alumni across the Valley was even more inspiring. From my understanding, the general consensus from students on the trip was that they were newly inspired and driven to get a career at a startup after graduating.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=cjbK9RaUPd0">Here&rsquo;s</a> a short video chronicling our trip.</p>
<h3 id="recruiting">Recruiting</h3>
<p>There is no shortage of startup opportunities for students, but it can be hard to sort out the good opportunities from the bad. The main recruiting mailing lists get 5-10 emails a day with startup opportunities. Here are a few excerpts of a few of the more interesting requests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are looking for a technical co-founder who can build and design all aspects of the website, including creating an attractive product and managing the back-end database. The programmer should know (or be willing and able to learn quickly) PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL at a minimum. Familiarity with jQuery would be beneficial. The programmer should be able to essentially replicate Pinterest, or be confident that they can learn how to do so in a short period of time. Please provide any examples of previous work, if any. Our engineer will be an equity partner in what we believe will be a very profitable business and great learning opportunity. We are also open to discussing salaried compensation instead of equity. The co-founder will join a team with experiences ranging from entrepreneurship, design, consulting, and law, and will learn about the contacts and skills necessary to start a new venture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a project which I need your assistance on. What am I offering? A partnership. I have a concept which I believe is worth pursuing. It most likely will involve php, sql, and rss. The first step would be letting me know if you are interested or not (I know some of you are very busy). The second step would be a non-disclosure agreement. I would then explain the concept, and you could tell me if you are interested in helping develop it. You would then tell me what percentage ownership in the company you would be seeking. I would then see which offer is a match between ownership and skills and select. You pick your own team. We will make it work. I look foward to hearing from you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, we also get a number of recruiting requests from exciting, well-funded San Francisco, New York, and Boston startups looking for students to fill internship and full-time positions.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in recruiting Harvard students, there are two main outlets to do so. First, contact the <a href="http://www.ocs.fas.harvard.edu/">Office of Career Services</a>. They&rsquo;re the official middleman between employers and students, and they&rsquo;re incredibly committed to increasing the number of students who go into the startup world after graduation. They can help get your job posting submitted into the Harvard job posting database, and will be able to tell you what career fairs are coming up. Second, submit your posting to <a href="mailto:hcs-jobs@lists.hcs.harvard.edu">hcs-jobs@lists.hcs.harvard.edu</a>. Most CS students are subscribed to that list, run by the Harvard Computer Society, so it&rsquo;s a good way to find qualified CS students.</p>
<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>
<p>In my opinion, Harvard&rsquo;s startup scene is a microcosm of the broader startup environment: There&rsquo;s a lot of noise, but there are many gems in the rough that will be hugely successful.</p>

<li>Has a loyal customer base</li>
<li>Allows customers to buy &ldquo;membership&rdquo; in return for special perks</li>

California, Texas, and Pennsylvania residents are all being charged tax. <a href="http://www.boston.com/businessupdates/2012/12/11/amazon-com-will-begin-collecting-taxes-massachusetts-governor-deval-patrick-says/WQnr45OToz1PRMH7nLcPZM/story.html">Just this week</a>, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick announced Amazon would begin charging a 6.25% sales tax next fall. Amazon&rsquo;s reaction to these states' actions is to open warehouses and distribution centers, seeking to reduce their already fast shipping time to hours, not days.</p>
<p>Now if you wanted to open a bunch of warehouses all across a state, located near consumers, in advance of a large-scale implementation of same-day shipping, you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find better locations than these:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a map of Costco locations across the U.S. Costco has 600+ large warehouses already built, near major metropolitan areas. There&rsquo;s no better way to reduce shipping time to customers than these centrally-located stores.</p>
<h3 id="warehouses">Warehouses</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between buying a supermarket, or a Best Buy, or any other store, and buying Costco.</p>
<p>All of Costco&rsquo;s stores are <em>warehouses</em>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s illustrate this for a second. Here&rsquo;s Costco:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ztjI4r_Qxvk7uA4Z.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s an Amazon warehouse:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TGihPbzkkOROJ2Qz.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>See the similarity? I can imagine <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/03/meet-little-orange-robots-making-amazons-warehouses-more-humane/50094/">Kiva Solutions' fulfillment robots</a> working behind the scenes at Costco warehouses, fulfilling a user&rsquo;s order while a customer picks up products in-person.</p>
<h3 id="buying-in-bulk">Buying in bulk</h3>
<p>Amazon has &ldquo;Subscribe and Save&rdquo;. Costco&rsquo;s whole premise is that you buy in bulk. The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/your-money/05money.html?pagewanted=all">published</a> an analysis of Costco&rsquo;s prices against Amazon&rsquo;s subscribe feature, and Costco came up as a cheaper option in most items, unless you take into account time to/from/at Costco. If Costco could ship to your door under the Amazon Prime umbrella, most people would just shop there.</p>
<h3 id="membership">Membership</h3>
<p>Amazon has Prime. Costco has, well, Costco membership. Both of them use membership programs to encourage customers to buy more and buy often. Costco membership runs for $55 or $110 a year, while Amazon Prime is $79 a year (less if you&rsquo;re a student).</p>
<h3 id="why-not-walmart">Why not Walmart?</h3>
<p>Assuming Amazon even wanted to buy a large physical retailer, it wouldn&rsquo;t have many choices, since there aren&rsquo;t many retail stores that cover the breadth of Amazon&rsquo;s product selection. Walmart comes to mind, but their market cap ($230B) makes the purchase prohibitively expensive for Amazon (market cap of $130B).</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I wrote this as a thought experiment after seeing the similarities of both Costco and Amazon on Black Friday and during the holiday shopping season. An outright merger probably won&rsquo;t happen, but the two companies are definitely similar in how they operate.</p>

<p>I love New York City. It&rsquo;s home, but it&rsquo;s also a million cities in one. You can go from one neighborhood to another in a span of blocks, and sometimes that transition can be jarring.</p>
<p>If you want a taste of those neighborhoods, just drive down Madison Avenue. Let&rsquo;s start at 57th and Madison. Looking downtown, we get a glimpse of IBM&rsquo;s offices.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hw3us07TgRlk5pMC.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking uptown, we see Mont Blanc and Coach stores across the street from each other. The next 40 blocks are similar: store after store selling luxury goods.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2KnsGy-SiIMbvBDM.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At 96th and Madison, the transition gradually begins. These large apartment buildings are the last ones you&rsquo;ll see with penthouses for a while.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*-2OLSzsKM25WIKNV.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>At 98th and Madison, you reach a 3 block stretch of Mount Sinai hospital complexes.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*IN9hM62KBpQUnDgG.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When I was a kid, there were only 2 buildings. Slowly but surely, the hospital has bought whole blocks of the surrounding area and built a complex of emergency rooms, teaching hospitals, and doctors' offices.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fOl8XxfBxfgHrjSL.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At 102nd and Madison, construction on a beautiful new building that houses classrooms for Mt. Sinai&rsquo;s medical school just finished.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bwDJf0qiTE6qNt2a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That new medical school sits across the street from the George Washington Carver houses, one of the first project complexes you&rsquo;ll enter on the way into East Harlem.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*3mh6qGVxcoqTbWJ9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And at 103rd and Madison, you see a 1950s-era public school across the street from another low-income housing complex. It&rsquo;s the school I attended for nearly 8 years in elementary school, but more on that later.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Z9Gr2AZUgo9lU8dp.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no real 100th and Madison, since 100th Street never actually intersects Madison. But it acts as a sort of &ldquo;Platform 9 3/4,&rdquo; dividing two very different socioeconomic classes. It&rsquo;s a divide that shouldn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*JSINqcgqCzv5wMlT.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s paint a more convincing picture. Here is a map of the city&rsquo;s ethnic makeup based on the 2010 census, courtesy of the <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/census/2010/map"><em>New York Times</em></a>. Each dot represents 25 people. Green dots represent White New Yorkers, blue dots represent Black New Yorkers. Yellow dots represent Hispanics, red dots represent Asians, purple dots represent Native Americans, and grey dots represent &ldquo;other&rdquo;. See that line on the right side of the image where green ends and yellow begins? That&rsquo;s 98th street.</p>

<p>How about a map of homicides from 2003-2011, also courtesy of the <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/crime/homicides/map"><em>New York Times</em></a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*pVyhDSQyg520cCEq.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Want a clearer picture? Here&rsquo;s a map of median income distribution from the 2010 census, courtesy of <a href="http://project.wnyc.org/acs2011/income.html"><em>WNYC</em></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*yYZzIsGP4nqeobzY.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At 96th St., median income is $184,583 +/- $75,883.</p>
<p>At 98th St., median income is $82,750 +/- $40,958.</p>
<p>At mythical 100th St. and the immediate area uptown, median income is $28,196 +/- $6,021.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s a $150,000 decrease of income potential in 4 blocks.</strong></p>
<p>The real issue is educational opportunity. Here is a graph of student performance, courtesy of the <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/new-york-schools-test-scores/"><em>New York Times</em></a>, at P.S. 77 Lower Lab, located at 96th Street and 3rd Avenue. P.S. 77 has 340 students total (K-8). 7% are &ldquo;poor,&rdquo; qualifying for the federal free lunch program. 92% of 3rd graders passed their state tests, 55% were advanced proficient, and only 5% were below standard.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*S0sXURcBOyoiY4pX.png" alt=""></p>
<p>P.S. 171&ndash;the school I attended from pre-kindergarten to 6th grade&ndash;is located at 103rd and Madison. It has 615 students total (K-8), 100% of whom qualify for federal free lunch. Of third graders, 64% passed their state tests, 24% were advanced proficient, and 2% were below standard.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TcgmWV9CkAxIic7D.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now for P.S. 146, located at 106th Street and 1st Avenue. It has 450 students, 88% of whom qualify for federal free lunch. <strong>Yet only 20% of third graders passed their state tests, 2% were advanced proficient, and 35% were below standard.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*xTYW05fnKPLOZ2DC.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is how cycles of poverty start. 3 schools, 3 very different educational outcomes.</p>
<p>A block can make a world of difference.</p>
